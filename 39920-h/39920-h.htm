1</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The following pages are a reprint of extracts from the file of
the <i>Norwich Mercury</i>, which, under the heading of
&ldquo;Yarmouth Notes,&rdquo; have recently appeared in the
columns of the <i>Yarmouth Mercury</i>; and in consequence of a
very generally expressed wish on the part of the public,
re-appear in the present form.</p>
<p>At the time these notices of Yarmouth News appeared in the
<i>Norwich Mercury</i>, that journal was the organ of the old
Whig party, and such of them, as treat of politics, being
doubtless tinged by the party feeling of the Editor, should be so
taken and read.</p>
<p>The idea of collating this matter suggested itself to the
compiler upon the occasion of Geo. Wm. Darby Palmer-Kerrison,
Esq., presenting the file of the <i>Norwich Mercury</i>, (then in
his Library), but which had been preserved by the late Robert
Palmer Kemp, Esq., to the Yarmouth Free Library, and it is hoped
that this action will not only prove of some entertainment and
amusement to the reader, but also will be of service to any
person who may, in the future, deal with local events as
affecting the history of the borough of Great Yarmouth.</p>

<h3>1830.</h3>
<p>Jan. 2nd.&mdash;Contains an advertisement of the report of the
&ldquo;Norfolk Association for preserving the lives of
Shipwrecked Mariners,&rdquo; held at Norwich, William Barth,
Esq., in the chair, from which it appears that an investigation
had taken place as to the loss of seven men from the brig Hamond,
and that as the lifeboat was not constructed with a view to
affording aid to vessels immediately on the beach, Mr. Ambrose
Palmer had most kindly offered to supply a boat for that
purpose.</p>
<p>Jan. 9th.&mdash;The prisoners in the gaol returned thanks to
Mr. Daniel Hook for the good dinner of &ldquo;roast beef and plum
pudding and a quart of ale each,&rdquo; which he had given them
on New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>Jan. 21.&mdash;Mr. William Ferrier had given a lecture on
Natural History, at the Mechanics&rsquo; Institution; and at an
adjourned meeting of the Public library, Mr. Charles Nicholls
entered upon the office of Treasurer in the room of the Rev. H.
R. Bowles, deceased; and Mr. Thomas Hammond was re-elected
librarian.</p>
<p>Jan. 28th.&mdash;Charles John Palmer, Esq., had been elected a
F.S.A.</p>
<p>Feb. 4th.&mdash;Navigation was stopped by the frost.</p>
<p>Feb. 11th.&mdash;A Fisherman&rsquo;s Provident Society had
been established, to which George Danby-Palmer, Esq., &ldquo;had
been a liberal subscriber, and had accepted the office of
treasurer, Mr. Thomas Hammond acting as secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>March 25th.&mdash;A meeting had been held at the New Hall
(George Bateman, Mayor, in the chair) to take into consideration
&ldquo;the expediency of building a new church,&rdquo; when
Robert Wall, Esq., George Danby-Palmer, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Esq., Samuel Tolver, Esq.
(Town-clerk), and Mr. Ferrier took part, and a resolution was
carried against the proposal to build the church.</p>
<p>April 3rd.&mdash;A boldly contested steeplechase had been run
off between several gentlemen of the Munro Hunt, when the prize,
a large silver Cup and cover, was won by H. Munro, Esq., who rode
the distance, from Fritton to Gorleston (above four miles), in
fifteen minutes.&nbsp; Above forty gentlemen afterwards dined at
the Bear.</p>
<p>April 15th.&mdash;A meeting had been held at the New Hall
&ldquo;for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the further
reduction of taxation and a retrenchment in the public
expenditure.&rdquo;&nbsp; George Danby-Palmer, Esq., was in the
chair, and William Barth, Esq., Simon Cobb, Esq., John Shelley,
Esq., John Burton Palmer, Esq., William Smith, Esq., Mr. John
Barnes, Mr. Boulton, Mr. Dennent, and Mr. Barrett, took part in
the proceedings.</p>

and in the town by a gale.</p>

chair) had been held for the purpose of appointing a select
vestry for the parish.</p>
<p>July 3rd.&mdash;Owing to the death of King George IV. the
paper appeared in mourning.</p>
<p>July 8th.&mdash;The Hon. Col. Anson and Mr. Rumbold had
arrived to canvass the Borough.</p>
<p>July 15th.&mdash;A funeral service had been held for the late
King (the Corporation attending in black robes, were afterwards
entertained by the Mayor to chocolate, &amp;c.)&nbsp; It was
estimated that there were 3,000 persons in the church.</p>
<p>July 22nd.&mdash;Messrs. Preston and Campbell (the Tory
candidates) had arrived.&nbsp; They were attended (so says the
advertisement) &ldquo;by upwards of 400 persons, 50 gentlemen on
horseback, and an enormous company of gentlemen in their
carriages, comprising all the consequence and wealth of the
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aug. 12th.&mdash;A meeting had been held to congratulate the
King on his accession to the Throne (George Danby-Palmer, Esq.,
in the chair); to the resolution then passed Mr. Palmer received
a reply from Sir Robert Peel, stating that the King had received
the same in a most gracious manner.</p>
<p>Aug. 15th.&mdash;Messrs. Anson and Rumbold had been returned
&ldquo;after a severe opposition by almost the entire force of
the Corporation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>poll closing&mdash;Anson, 944;
Rumbold, 944; Campbell, 754; Preston, 754.&nbsp; A dinner of
their supporters (W. Barth, Esq., in the chair) was afterwards

<p>Aug. 26th.&mdash;Contains an advertisement that &ldquo;the old
annual main of cocks would be fought near the Feathers&rsquo;
Inn, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 7th and 8th September, between
the gentlemen of Norwich and Yarmouth, for five sovs. a battle
and 50 the odds.&nbsp; Feeders&mdash;Stafford, Norwich, and Lamb,

proceedings.</p>
<p>Dec. 23rd.&mdash;The self-styled Gorleston and Southtown
Corporation dissolved, and formed itself into the &ldquo;Hand in
Hand Friendly Society,&rdquo; and it was ordered that &ldquo;the
regalia of the late Corporation should be sold and the money
arising therefrom distributed among the poor of the
parish.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>1831.</h3>
<p>Feb. 10th&mdash;<i>The Gorleston and Southtown Magazine</i>
had been issued in weekly numbers or monthly parts, and contained
a biographical notice of Mr. Dawson Turner, F.S.A., &amp;c.</p>
<p>Feb. 17th.&mdash;Amongst the vessels lost and driven ashore by
the then late gales were the Alfred (Simmonds), the Flora, the
Juno (Moss), the Elizabeth and Mary Welch (Amis), and the Anson
(Garwood).</p>
<p>March 5th.&mdash;Contains the following notice of Mr.
Palmer&rsquo;s Fancy Dress Ball:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">MR. PALMER&rsquo;S
FANCY BALL.</p>
<p>In our notice of this amusement at the late Festival, we
recollect to have said&mdash;&ldquo;The ice has been broken, the
pleasure has been felt, and we shall be mistaken if the next
effort be not more successful.&rdquo;&nbsp; This prediction, <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>intended at the
time to be applied to future festivals, we did not expect to be
so soon, so completely, or so successfully fulfilled, as in the
instance we now have the pleasure to record.&nbsp; This
entertainment was given at the Town Hall on Tuesday evening last,
in celebration of the attainment of his majority by Mr. S.
Palmer, the grandson of the late Danby Palmer, Esq., whose
extended private connections and still wider mercantile pursuits
have bequeathed to his grandson a more numerous portion of
friends than it is the lot of most persons to enjoy at an early
period of life.&nbsp; The invitations were sent out with such
hospitality, the preparations were on so munificent a scale, that
the spirit of the donor seemed to diffuse itself not only to all
those who were about to be present, but to all the inhabitants of
the borough.&nbsp; The novelty, the continued arrivals, the
firing of cannon, the banners floating at the Town Hall, and in
various parts of the town, the gay appearance of the ships in the
harbour, most of which were decorated with pennons, as were
several vessels in the Roads&mdash;all aided in keeping alive the
expectation, so that in the evening the Quay, around the hall,
was crowded with persons anxious to see the company&mdash;so
anxious, indeed, that the carriage windows were assailed by men
and women jumping up to get a peep at the interior.&nbsp; The
company began to assemble about half-past eight, and on entering
the ball room were announced by name, and received by Mr. Palmer
and his mother and Miss A. Burton (to whom, we understand, Mr.
Palmer is about to be united.)&nbsp; These ladies appeared in
very elegant Court dresses, and Mr. Palmer in a full-dress Court
suit.&nbsp; Till ten o&rsquo;clock the company continued to
arrive, at which hour Mr. Palmer opened the Ball by leading off a
country dance with Miss A. Burton.&nbsp; We never saw a similar
entertainment combining so great a variety of character.&nbsp;
The brilliancy of the colours and the constant succession of
costumes, the reliefs, the contrasts, and the varying shades,
reminded us forcibly of those beautiful combinations formed by
the kaleidoscope, of which, visually, this scene may be said to
have been an animated representation.&nbsp; On the one side of a
quadrille was to be seen the gawdy Spaniard, leading with haughty
dignity the lively Mrs. Ford of the Elizabethian age; while
behind him stood pondering o&rsquo;er the fleeting vanity of this
world the solitary Friar; opposite ranged the joyous Sailor,
indulging his mirth at the expense of the courtly dignity of his
fair partner.&nbsp; At one end was the Old Gentleman of two
centuries since, in all the gravity and politeness of that age,
leading forth some sprightly Tyrolese; while at the other was a
Chinese Mandarin, paired off with a black-eyed Gipsy; <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>a little
further, and the Scotchman promenaded with the brilliant
Circassian; the Frieselander with the simply-dressed Quakeress;
the Queen of Scots with the bronze and fierce Turk; the reckless
Massaroni with the lively Mrs. Page; the dark Colombian with the
prim lady of an hundred years ago; the Forester with the Flower
Girl; the haughty Knight Templar with the simple Swiss Peasant;
the chivalrous Pole with the heavy Russian; the youthful Ivanhoe
with a French Peasant; and to crown the diversity, Day and Night
were to be seen at once, arm and arm with a Chimney Sweep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>April 14th.&mdash;The Preston (Capt. Woodthorpe), with
passengers, for Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island and Quebec, had been
towed down the Harbour.</p>
<p>May 5th.&mdash;This number contains the following account of
the Borough Election, consequent upon the rejection of a Reform
Bill:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Mayor, in opening the proceedings, said that
the electors were met to exercise an important trust, that of
electing two persons to represent the Borough&mdash;a trust at
all times of the greatest responsibility, but certainly never
more so than at the present eventful crisis.&nbsp; Determined as
he was to act with strict justice, and with that fairness and
impartiality which were the best ornaments of the office he had
the honour to hold, he entreated that the contest in which they
were now about to be engaged might be conducted on both sides
with that order and decorum that forbearance and moderation due
from gentlemen to gentlemen, and from man to man.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)</p>
<p>Mr. B. Dowson, in a brief but emphatic address, put in
nomination the Hon. George Anson, this was seconded by R. Palmer
Kemp, Esq.</p>
<p>T. Clowes, Esq., then proposed, in an address replete with
sterling sense and strength, C. E. Rumbold, Esq., seconded by J.
Shelley, Esq., who adverted to the circumstance of Mr. Colville
being a merchant connected with the West Indian Trade and a
supporter of colonial slavery.</p>
<p>I. Preston, Esq., jun., and &mdash; White, Esq., nominated A.
Colville, Esq., and J. Lacon, Esq., jun., and Mr. J. Laws
nominated W. Bliss, Esq.</p>
<p>Col. Anson and Mr. Rumbold addressed the electors at
considerable length, pointing out the merits of the measure they
supported, during which they were enthusiastically cheered.</p>
<p>Mr. Colville also spoke at length, amid much tumult, during
which he was interrupted by loud yells of various
kinds&mdash;attacking the Bill for its disfranchising nature, and
defending colonial slavery.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Mr.
Bliss had not arrived at that time.</p>
<p>A poll was determined and immediately opened and continued
till five o&rsquo;clock on that and the following day, when the
numbers were announced by the Committee of Anson and Rumbold to
be&mdash;</p>

more than commonly exhilarating, by the agreeable information
quickly diffused through the town, that the enemies of freedom
and of the Constitution had fled, happy in evading and escaping
from merited punishment, so irritated were the minds of the lower
class of society against these obtruders, without a shadow of
claim to their suffrages, that, by their flight on Sunday
morning, they probably escaped an ablution in the waters of the
beautiful river Yare.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>This vexatious contest, for it was vexatious,
inasmuch as it was opposed to the general wish of the
inhabitants, as not the slightest chance of success prevailed
from the commencement, and the only object of which was to
extract money from the purses of the two Members, terminated, not
only in the triumphant defeat of the Boroughmongers, but by
affording a lesson to the Charles Street Society in London, whose
only object is to continue corruption, by the means of
corruption, a proof that true independence and love of country is
far beyond the purchase of the greatest wealth.&nbsp; But the
friends of Reform at Yarmouth have set a noble example of
consistency, for they have commenced among themselves one of the
modes which the Reform Bill will enforce.&nbsp; They have
determined to raise among themselves a sum sufficient to defray
the legal expenses of the election, and to return their
well-tried Members as unhurt in their finances as they are
independent in principal, and by this mark of gratitude and
esteem to repay the obligations which the <a

of Yarmouth in common with the country at large owe to the
supporters of the Reform Bill&mdash;&pound;1,750&mdash;has

enthusiastic cheers.</p>

stone of St. Peter&rsquo;s Church:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some days past notices had been issued that the
first stone of the new Church, to be erected in this town, was to
be laid this day; and at half-past ten this morning the Mayor,
Corporation, gentry, and inhabitants assembled at the Town Hall,
and proceeded to St. Nicholas&rsquo; Church.&nbsp; Prayers were
read by the Rev. Harvey Bawtree, and after service the procession
moved in the following order:&mdash;Bellman, Church Beadles,
Constables, the Corporation Band, Hospital Charity Children,
Inhabitants and Gentry, Officers of the Navy, Mr. J. J. Scoles,
the Architect, the Clergy of Yarmouth and its vicinity, the
Regalia, the Right Worshipful Edmund Preston, Esq., the Mayor,
his Majesty&rsquo;s Lieutenant for the County, the Hon. and Very
Rev. Dr. Pellew, Dean of Norwich, and the Rev. Richard Turner,
the Right Hon. and Rev. Viscount Nevill, the Deputy-Mayor, the
Aldermen in their scarlet gowns, the Common Councilmen,
Constables.&nbsp; On arriving at the ground, the procession
passed once round the building to the north-east corner.</p>
<p>A copy of the inscription, which had been written on vellum,
and placed with the coins of the present King in a bottle,
hermetically sealed, was then read by the Town Clerk:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great Yarmouth.&mdash;The first stone of
this Church, dedicated to St. Peter, and erected by His
Majesty&rsquo;s Commissioners for building new Churches (under
the authority of an Act of Parliament, 58th Geo. III. c. 45) on a
site granted by the Corporation, and with the assistance of their
donations, and the subscriptions of several of the inhabitants of
the town and its vicinity, was laid on the seventh day of July,
in the second year of the reign of His Most Gracious Majesty King
William the Fourth, <span class="smcap">mdcccxxxi</span>., by the
Right Worshipful Edmund Preston, Esquire, Mayor; the Right
Reverend Henry Bathurst, Lord Bishop of the Diocese; the
Honourable and Very Reverend George Pellew, D.D., Dean of
Norwich; the Honourable and Reverend Edward Pellew, M.A.,
Minister of the parish.&nbsp; Architect, Joseph John Scoles;
contractors, John Pigg, Jeremiah Wright, George Cattermole,
Samuel Bligh, James Watson.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The children sang the 100th Psalm during the operation of
inserting <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>the bottle in a cavity, and securing the stone, which
had been prepared to receive it.&nbsp; A silver trowel was then
presented by the Architect, and after the Mayor had spread the
mortar, the stone was lowered to the proper place, and the
ceremony of striking it was performed by the Clergy and
Corporation in succession.</p>
<p>The Dean offered up appropriate prayers, accompanied by an
address expressly composed for this occasion.&nbsp; The children
then sang a collect.&nbsp; The Mayor afterwards addressed the
company present, on the pious work which they had assisted in
commencing; amidst the general plaudits of the surrounding
multitude the band struck up &ldquo;God save the King,&rdquo; and
the company returned to the Town Hall and partook of an elegant
cold collation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church, which has been so happily begun, is
calculated to contain 1,800 persons, and three-fifths of the
seats are to be appropriated for ever as free
sittings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>August 25th.&mdash;Contains the following
notice:&mdash;&ldquo;By invitation from the Mayor and Mrs.
Preston, on Monday sennight, to a promenade at their beautiful
garden, situate on the banks of the river Yare, were assembled
almost all the fashion of the town and its vicinity.&nbsp; At
seven o&rsquo;clock the band struck up the national air of
&ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo; immediately after which the
younger part of the company formed themselves into quadrilles,
&amp;c., upon the grass plat, near the centre of which tables
were supplied with wines of the first quality and every
refreshment in season.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock a fire
balloon ascended from the grounds in very fine style, which was
visible on the grounds and town for about twenty minutes.&nbsp;
The amusements concluded with a brilliant display of
fireworks.&nbsp; The extreme serenity of the evening, aided by
the wild light of the moon and the more refulgent illumination of
the garden with variegated lamps, rendered this a scene which for
good humour and pleasantness has rarely or ever been equalled in
this town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sept. 1st.&mdash;Mr. Shelly attended the Corporation meeting
and insisted on reading a protest in respect of the
non-attendance of that body to their
&ldquo;ordinance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following officers were then
elected:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mayor-Elect&mdash;John Preston, Esq.</p>
<p>Chamberlain&mdash;Mr. E. Youell.</p>
<p>Churchwardens&mdash;S. Paget, Esq., and Mr. T. E. Laws.</p>

<p>After the above account of sport, it is needless to say that
everyone who attended the Races was delighted.&nbsp; The severe
running on the first day prevented several of the horses starting
on the second, but the four well-contested heats for the Town and
Country Gentlemen&rsquo;s Plate more than compensated for the
deficiency in the number of horses.&nbsp; The ordinaries and Ball
were well attended&mdash;a very liberal subscription was entered
into for the Races of 1832.&nbsp; The Gold Cup Stakes is already
filled, and the Norfolk and Suffolk Hunters&rsquo; Stake of 5
sovs. each, with 20 sovs. added, for horses not thoroughbred,
which have been regularly hunted in either of the above counties,
has already six subscribers.&nbsp; The ladies at the Ball on
Tuesday evening commenced a subscription for a Ladies&rsquo;
Plate of 50 sovs. for next year, which will be in addition to the
two Fifty Pounds Plates usually given.&nbsp; Edmund Preston,
Esq., is appointed one of the stewards for 1832.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sept. 29th.&mdash;The Reformers of Yarmouth &ldquo;had an
excellent meeting&rdquo; at the Town-hall.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman
Barth was in the chair, and Messrs. Clowes, S. Cobb, Shelley,
Hammond, Sewell, and Munsey took part in the proceedings.</p>
<p>Oct. 6th.&mdash;The Mayor (John Preston, Esq.,)
&ldquo;celebrated his inauguration at the Town-hall on Thursday
sennight by a sumptuous entertainment, which was attended by the
Lord Lieutenant, Judge Alderson, Sir W. Folkes, M.P., the Hon. E.
Pellew, and about 300 gentlemen of the county and
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nov. 17th.&mdash;A Board of Health had been established for
the better cleansing the streets and lanes, and the removal of
nuisances.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Star&rdquo; coach, when about a mile this side of
Eye, was driven into by &ldquo;a fellow in a drunken
state,&rdquo; and one of the leaders was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>Nov. 24th.&mdash;The dairy of John Waters, Esq., of Ormesby,
had been broken into and 16 pints of butter, 14 cheeses, a fat
goose, and a quantity of meat and flour stolen.</p>
<p>Large flocks of &ldquo;Stormy Petrels&rdquo; had visited our
shores, and between 6 and 7 dozen of them taken alive; several
&ldquo;Little Auks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Arctic Gulls&rdquo; had also
been shot.</p>

<p>The case of the King against the Aldermen of Yarmouth is
reported.</p>
<p>Feb. 9th.&mdash;With regard to which the following notice
appears this week:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">THE KING AGAINST THE ALDERMEN OF
YARMOUTH.</span></p>
<p>We are authorized to state that the Report of the hearing of
this cause, in our last week&rsquo;s paper, is incorrect, Lord
Tenterden having observed that there was no ground for an
attachment, as the parties had acted <i>bona fide</i>; that the
business of the Corporation must be done, and directed that the
rule should be enlarged, to give the Defendants an opportunity of
doing so.&nbsp; The Counsel for the Defendants said they were
ready to proceed, but could not compel the Mayor to call an
Assembly, or the Common Councilmen to meet,&mdash;whereupon his
Lordship, on the motion of Defendants&rsquo; Counsel, directed a
mandamus to be issued for the filling up all vacancies, and then
transacting the other necessary business; and upon a Return being
made to the Writ, the Rule will be discharged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feb. 16th&mdash;A general meeting of the inhabitants was
proposed to be held to take into consideration the expediency of
erecting a new Workhouse, &ldquo;it appearing by a report of the
select Vestry now published, that the present one is quite
inadequate to the purpose, both as to extent and arrangement, and
as being utterly incapable of affording room for that
classification which is indispensable to the moral improvement
and employment of its inmates, and also to the comfort of the
aged and infirm.&nbsp; It is now about fifty years since any room
was added to it.&nbsp; The increase of inhabitants in the town,
and not less so of pauperism during that period, calls for
enlarged accommodation.&nbsp; It appears by the report that they
are without a day room for the females, or any means of
separating the sick from the healthy, and so cramped for lodging
room, that a considerable <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>number of the inmates are compelled
to sleep three in a bed.&nbsp; It is intended to proceed
agreeably to the directions of the 59th Geo. III. cap 12, and 1st
and 2nd of William IV. cap. 42.&rdquo;</p>
<p>March 22nd.&mdash;The National Fast had been observed
&ldquo;with a decent solemnity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>April 5th.&mdash;The appointment of a Recorder is noticed as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;At a Corporate Assembly, held on Tuesday
last, the long-contested question of &lsquo;who should fill the
office of Recorder for the borough?&rsquo; (vacant by the
resignation of Robert Alderson, Esq.,) was decided.&nbsp; The
first business which came before the Court was the accepting of
that gentleman&rsquo;s resignation, after which Isaac Preston,
Sen., Esq., proposed the Sub-Steward (I. Preston, Esq.,) to fill
the vacant office; this was seconded by C. Symonds, Esq.&nbsp; R.
Cory, Esq., then proposed Mr. Sergeant Merewether; this
nomination was seconded by Samuel Paget, Esq.&nbsp; On a ballot
being demanded, the numbers were found to be equal, viz., 20 for
Merewether and the same number for Preston.&nbsp; There were 41
members of the body present, one of whom declined voting.&nbsp; A
second ballot was proposed and acceded to, and the same result
followed.&nbsp; The Deputy-Mayor (who presided in consequence of
the extreme ill health of the Mayor) then said that he would give
the members of the Court the chance of a third ballot, on which
the gentleman before mentioned voted for Merewether, which gave
the learned Sergeant a majority of one, the numbers being for
Merewether 21, for Preston 20.&nbsp; Thus has terminated this
long agitated question, the product of much squabbling, aye, and
of much litigation too.&nbsp; Lord Viscount Exmouth was
unanimously chosen Lord High Steward; Isaac Preston, Jun., Esq.,
and J. Baker, Esq., were elected Aldermen; and Messrs. J. E.
Lacon, E. H. L. Preston, Henry Costerton and Samuel Jay, Common
Councilmen.&nbsp; At this Court, Mr. J. Seaman received the
appointment of Parish Clerk, and Mr. J. Daniel, Sexton; 50
guineas were also voted to St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, Southtown;
&pound;15 per year granted to Mrs. Breeze (widow of the late
hall-keeper), and &pound;12 annuity settled on Mrs. Absolon
(widow of the late Parish Clerk.)&nbsp; It was likewise ordered
that the usual fee of 20s. upon apprentices&rsquo; indentures
should be taken off.&nbsp; It is only right to state that the
entire business of the day was conducted in the most amicable way
possible, and that the greatest good temper and gentlemanly
feeling was displayed during the discussion on the pending
Recordership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>April 12th.&mdash;The thanks of the Corporation were voted to
the Rev. R. Turner upon his resignation of his office of Chaplain
to that body.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>The
Sylvan (owned by J. H. Palmer, Esq., and commanded by Captain W.
Gilham) and the Preston (belonging to I. Preston, Esq.) had
respectively sailed with 100 and 110 emigrants.</p>
<p>April 19th.&mdash;Two more emigrant vessels, the Syren and
Miser, were advertised to sail for America.&mdash;On Friday, then
last, (here commonly called Black Friday) the annual meeting had
been held at the Guild Hall for the purpose of &ldquo;reading
over&rdquo; the income and expenditure of our local affairs when
&ldquo;secundum custom (sic.) it was proved that the receipts of
any sum, say &pound;5,299, and the payment of &pound;5,298 was
balanced by &pound;1 being added to the credit side.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Shelly and other gentlemen protested against the manner in
which these accounts were made out and presented to the
freemen.</p>
<p>April 26th.&mdash;The newly elected Common Councilmen, Messrs.
John Lacon, E. H. L. Preston, Henry Costerton, and Samuel Jay
entertained the Corporation and others.&nbsp; John Lacon, Esq.,
presided, and the following toasts were given:&mdash;The King,
Queen Adelaide, Princess Victoria, and the Royal Family, Lord
Hill and the Army, Sir James Graham and the Navy, Lord Viscount
Exmouth, the County Members, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Burglaries had been committed on the premises of Mr. William
Green, Messrs. Bracey and Son, Mr. Benjamin Welch, and Mr. Joseph
Stevenson, and a man named Woolsey had been charged with the
offences.</p>
<p>May 3rd.&mdash;The Fair had been held without &ldquo;A
Yarmouth Fair Wind,&rdquo; and was &ldquo;very numerously and
respectably attended, nor could its visitants complain of lack of
amusements, for of remarkable giantesses, as remarkable dwarfs,
optical dioramas, &amp;c., &amp;c., there were quantum suff,
while roundabouts, Russian swings, and ups-and-downs displayed
themselves in abundance to allure the juvenile part of the
company out of their stray half-pence and pence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 10th.&mdash;The southern bastion of the fort had fallen
&ldquo;with an immense crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;first fruits of the fishing season&rdquo; had been
landed by a boat, (No. 3), belonging to Mr. George Giles.&nbsp;
The night&rsquo;s haul had produced 48 mackerel, which sold at
1s. 6d. each.</p>
<p>The following vessels had been launched:&mdash;The brig Sarah,
190 tons (from Messrs. Tuck&rsquo;s yard), and the brig Sarepta,
160 tons (from Mr. Lubbock&rsquo;s yard.)</p>
<p>May 17th.&mdash;The news that the Duke of Wellington had
&ldquo;given in <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>and that Lord Grey was then at the palace&rdquo; was
received with joy, and the bells had been rung.</p>
<p>May 24th.&mdash;The Rattlesnake (180 tons) had been launched
from Mr. F. Preston&rsquo;s yard.</p>
<p>The mackerel fishery was going on badly, and there was great
distress in the town, as thousands depended on that industry for
a living.</p>
<p>May 31st.&mdash;There had been a great fire at Messrs. Grout
and Co&rsquo;s. Factory, the loss estimated at &pound;12,000, the
premises were uninsured.</p>
<p>Two female factory hands, aged respectively 16 and 17, had
&ldquo;fought it out&rdquo; on the Denes, the prize, a
&ldquo;young tar,&rdquo; when the &ldquo;shorter combatant&rdquo;
proved victorious.</p>
<p>June 7th.&mdash;The King&rsquo;s birthday had been celebrated
with a great display of flags, the firing of the Church bells,
salutes from the Forts, batteries, etc.</p>
<p>June 14th.&mdash;The following notice appears as to the Reform
Act:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">REFORM.</span></p>
<p>For some days previous to the passing of the new Magna Charta
of our liberties, the Reform Bill, the friends of that great and
really Conservative measure had met at the Ship Tavern, for the
purpose of considering the best method of celebrating the
anticipated triumph.&nbsp; At their first meeting it was
determined to open a subscription, leaving the precise manner in
which the proceeds should be expended as a matter for future
consideration.&nbsp; District Committees were forthwith appointed
to manage the collections.&nbsp; The subscription, which is not
yet closed, is expected to amount to something very
handsome.&nbsp; It was first intended to give the freemen a
dinner, but on sounding the latter it was found that they
(without any exception) preferred receiving a pecuniary present;
it was therefore at a subsequent meeting resolved, that each of
those persons should receive a donation in money, and that the
friends of Reform should dine together at a time and place
hereafter to be appointed.&nbsp; The news of the passing of the
unmutilated Bill was received here with every demonstration of
joy.&nbsp; The vessels at the Quay displayed a profusion of
flags, as did also the principal taverns and inns in the
town&mdash;indeed everything seemed to show a universal gladness
of heart.&nbsp; On Friday last, however, when information arrived
of the Royal sanction having been given to the Bill, the fullness
of joy exhibited on the occasion knew no bounds.&nbsp; Expectant
of the event, a large party of our townsmen (of every grade and
condition in life) had proceeded along the Southtown Road on the
forenoon of the day, <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>accompanied by a band, flags with
appropriate mottoes, &amp;c., to meet the Telegraph.&nbsp;
Singular enough, however, the guard of that coach refused to take
up the colours, and in answer to repeated enquiries declared
&ldquo;there was no news,&rdquo; although it was afterwards
ascertained that he had read from a newspaper in his possession
an account of the Royal signature to the inhabitants of Gorleston
while passing through that village.&nbsp; The Reformers of
Yarmouth, to show their indignant sense of such conduct, refused
to wait at night for the Morning Star (that coach being under the
same proprietory as the Telegraph), but instantly sent a courier
to Lowestoft to announce their intention of meeting, in
procession, the Old Blue.&nbsp; Ultimately, that coach,
surrounded by a profusion of elegant and appropriate flags, bands
playing, &amp;c., paraded the town.&nbsp; It was really a most
animating and exhilarating spectacle; numbers of elegant and
beautiful females assembled at the windows to witness the
heart-cheering sight of a countless multitude of persons,
composed of all ranks in life, alike animated by one feeling,
that of exultation and delight.&nbsp; Surely after this our
enemies will no longer prate of a reaction!&nbsp; At any rate,
such a flagrant attempt at delusion would be scouted by our
patriotic townsmen, as one of the basest of libels on old
Yarmouth * * * * The public dinner, rejoicings, &amp;c., will, we
have just heard, not take place till after the passing of the
Scotch and Irish Bills.&nbsp; The dinner, will, we believe, be
held at the Town Hall, there being no reason to doubt that the
Mayor, with his accustomed gentlemanly feeling, will grant the
building for that purpose.&nbsp; Wm. Barth, Esq., is expected to
preside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the Spring eight vessels had sailed from Yarmouth to
different parts of the Canadas, carrying 916 passengers.</p>
<p>June 21st.&mdash;The Haven and Pier Commissioners had attended
for the purpose of examining the Harbour Works, and it was hoped
that extensive improvements would be made therein.</p>
<p>The Conservatives had not announced any candidates, and it was
considered probable that Messrs. Anson and Rumbold would be
re-elected.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Griffith, junr., had delivered a very impressive
sermon on board the Cyrus under the Bethel Flag.</p>
<p>June 28th.&mdash;The Corporation had voted an address to the
King upon his escape from the late &ldquo;atrocious&rdquo; attack
upon him.</p>
<p>A vessel was lying off the Pier Head with the Yellow Flag
(cholera) flying.</p>
<p>July 5th.&mdash;A public dinner was to be held to celebrate
the passing <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>of the Reform Bill, and Mr. Windham, the Liberal
candidate for E. Norfolk, was to meet his friends, Major Keppel
being unable to accompany him.</p>
<p>July 12th.&mdash;The Dreadnought lugger (having on board a
large cargo of smuggled goods) had been captured.</p>
<p>The Sylvan (belonging to J. H. Palmer, Esq.,) had arrived at
Quebec with emigrants.</p>
<p>July 26th.&mdash;The annual water frolic is thus noticed:
&ldquo;Monday last was our annual water frolic.&nbsp; The
heavens, which appeared inauspiciously to lour during the early
part of the day, cleared about noon, and a cloudless and sun-lit
sky enabled the admirers of boating excursions to enjoy with high
zest the pleasures afforded them by the recurrence of this
aquatic treat.&nbsp; The beautiful bosom of Breydon was literally
covered with craft of every description, from the stately barge
and elegant pleasure boat, down to the humble punt.&nbsp; Three
boats, the Coriander, Balls; the Emerald, of Lowestoft, Col.
Jones; and the Hornet, of Beccles (the two latter latteeners),
were the competitors for the cup.&nbsp; The former had the start,
and kept the lead during the three heats, and eventually won by
400 yards.&nbsp; About five o&rsquo;clock p.m. the boats drew up
for dinner.&nbsp; The <i>toute ensemble</i> was at this time
picturesque in the extreme, the river, as we have said, studded
with boats of various descriptions; the rond (which at this time
was more than usually dry and firm) crowded with well-dressed
persons of both sexes, whose joyous countenances showed that they
looked gratifyingly on the sight; the beautiful ruins of Burgh
Castle (the Garianonum of the ancients) in the distance, gilded
with the gloomy brightness of a western sun&mdash;the declivity
of the hill bedecked with many tea-drinking parties, all
presented a scene which must have given delight to every true
lover of his species.&nbsp; On the following day a cup (the gift
of the spirited landlord of the Berney Arms) was sailed for by
five 14 feet boats, which was won by the Sultan, George
Alexander, who beat her antagonists hollow.&nbsp; We are happy to
say that the general feeling of pleasure was not alloyed by the
occurrence of a single accident.&rdquo;</p>

the words &ldquo;Gorleston and Southtown Voters&rdquo; upon

residing in or near Yarmouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oct. 11th.&mdash;The herring fishing had been very
unsuccessful.&nbsp; This was attributed to warm weather.</p>
<p>Oct. 18th.&mdash;The following notice as to the Wandering
Piper appears:&mdash;&ldquo;The Wandering Piper, who has
attracted so much notoriety, is expected to visit Yarmouth in the
course of a very few days.&nbsp; He is of a rank in life which
few suspect who are not acquainted with his private
history.&nbsp; He was for a considerable time an officer in the
Army, served under Sir John Moore and the Duke of Wellington, and
sold his commission after the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; His
opponent is Count Bender, a French Nobleman, but educated in
Scotland at the same school with the piper, and betwixt him a
great friendship subsisted.&nbsp; They met in London in 1825,
when a dispute arose between them concerning the hospitality of
different nations, which ended in both parties finally agreeing,
for the sum of &pound;5,000, to travel in disguise, the one as a
fiddler in France and <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Belgium, and the other (our hero) as
a piper in Britain and Ireland, to subsist upon what the public
might be pleased to give them unsolicited, and whoever should
have most money in the end was to gain the prize.&nbsp; They both
commenced their wanderings in the summer of 1825, but an uncle of
the piper&rsquo;s, who then held a high official situation,
having got notice of the freak, put a stop to the proceedings
before the end of three months; this gentleman, however, died in
1827, which left both parties free from restraint, in consequence
of which they started in August, 1828, the one from Stonehaven,
in Scotland, and the other from Calais, in France.&nbsp; This
important campaign was only intended to last three years, and
would have been finished before now had not the piper received a
severe hurt from the upsetting of a stage coach in Ireland, which
confined him for fifteen months&mdash;during which time there was
a secession of hostilities on both sides.&nbsp; The piper during
his illness lay at the house of Sir Thomas Butler, Bart.,
Ballintemple, county Carlow, where he met with the greatest
kindness; indeed, the Irish, high and low, seem to have
completely entered into the spirit of the undertaking.&nbsp; He
was never allowed in any one instance to pay anything at the
hotels where he put up, waiter, chambermaid, boots, and porter
all refused to accept of any remuneration for their services,
nay, the very beggar wished his &lsquo;honour good luck and a
safe journey,&rsquo; without laying him under further
contribution.&nbsp; He says that he has been charged in all
instances to the very utmost extent in England; we could have
wished it had been otherwise, for the honour of our national
character.&nbsp; During his rambles, it is said he had given
&pound;550 to different charities, that receipts for which are
lodged for safety with John Stuart, Esq., of 19, Cleveland Row,
Finsbury Square, London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oct. 25th.&mdash;The wandering piper had begun his rounds and
had lunched with the Mayor.</p>
<p>Nov. 8th&mdash;Electioneering partizanship was displaying
itself.&nbsp; A &ldquo;True Red Committee (composed of the lowest
order of beer-loving Burgesses) had been formed&rdquo; and Andrew
Colville, Esq., had been requested to stand for the Borough in
that interest.</p>
<p>Nov. 15th.&mdash;Mr. Colville had arrived in the Borough and
addressed the electors from the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; balcony.</p>
<p>Dec. 6th.&mdash;Contains the following article:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Tuesday last was a proud day for the friends of
Reform, comprising as they do a vast majority of all ranks of our
town&rsquo;s-people.&nbsp; It having been announced by hand-bill
the day previous that Col. Anson and Mr. Rumbold would <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>arrive the
following day, as early as the hour at noon, the Southtown Road
was crowded with pedestrians and equestrians of all
classes.&nbsp; Between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock the entire
body of the Political Union (full 400 strong) assembled at the
Guardian Angel, with blue ribbons and their badges round their
necks.&nbsp; The worthy candidates having arrived at the above
inn, the procession began to move in the following
order:&mdash;Two trumpeters on horseback; banner&mdash;Yarmouth
Union of the Working Classes; flags&mdash;Union Jack, Royal
Standard of England; &lsquo;Universal Suffrage and Vote by
Ballot&rsquo;; &lsquo;Short Parliaments and Liberty of the
Press&rsquo;; &lsquo;The love of our Country leads us&rsquo;;
&lsquo;Close Corporations abolished&rsquo;; &lsquo;Equal Laws and
Equal Rights&rsquo;; &lsquo;United we stand, divided we
fall&rsquo;; banners of the King and Reform.&nbsp;
Flags&mdash;&lsquo;Gorleston and Southtown Voters&rsquo;;
&lsquo;Anson and Rumbold&rsquo;; &lsquo;Friends.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Flags&mdash;&lsquo;The People&rsquo;s Cause&rsquo;; &lsquo;The
Poor Man&rsquo;s Rights&rsquo;; &lsquo;Reduction of
Taxation&rsquo;; &lsquo;Close Corporations Opened&rsquo;;
&lsquo;Abolition of Slavery&rsquo;; &lsquo;Cheap Government and
Equal Rights&rsquo;; &lsquo;The Liberty of the Press&rsquo;;
&lsquo;Knowledge is Power&rsquo;; &lsquo;Civil and Religious
Liberty&rsquo;; &lsquo;Freedom of Election.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
procession, on entering the town by the Bridge, was welcomed by
the exultant shouts of an innumerable concourse of expectant
individuals, who had by this time lined the new Hall Quay, eager
to witness the imposing spectacle.&nbsp; The blue pennons of
numerous ships, &lsquo;floating in the breeze,&rsquo; added not a
little to the joyousness of the occasion.&nbsp; The procession
moved on, adding to its numbers as it advanced along the Quay, up
South Street, along King Street, down our beautiful Market Place,
and back to the Committee Rooms, from the windows of which the
assembled multitude (consisting certainly of not less than 5,000
persons) were addressed by Mr. Alderman Barth, Col. Anson, Mr.
Rumbold, and J. Shelly, Esq.&nbsp; The weather was till towards
noon rather showery; fortunately it then cleared up.&nbsp; Such,
however, appeared to us the general enthusiasm, that it seemed as
if no weather could have damped the universal feeling of delight,
nor have abated the desire to witness the proceedings of this
memorable day.&nbsp; Numbers of well-dressed females from the
windows of the houses, as the procession passed along, were to be
seen, with approving smiles, shaking blue flags, elegant banners,
&amp;c., &amp;c., thus demonstrating their hearty participation
in the high feeling of satisfaction which displayed itself all
around.&nbsp; Too much praise cannot be given to Capt. Garson and
Mr. Gamble for the judgment shown by them in marshalling the
procession.&nbsp; Nor ought we to omit mentioning, in terms of
high commendation, the <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>excellent conduct of the Union on the
occasion&mdash;conduct which was noticed in the evening at the
King&rsquo;s Head, by the Chairman (Mr. T. Hammond) making a very
handsome acknowledgment of their services, and giving as a toast
(which was drank with three times three and very general
applause) &lsquo;The Council of the Political Union.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Surely, if it had been before possible for the Conservatives (as
they improperly styled themselves) to have mistaken the feeling
of the town, the proceedings of Tuesday last must have entirely
undeceived them, and enabled them to see the utter hopelessness
of a contest with our late excellent representatives.&nbsp;
Monday next is the day of election, when we shall see whether
these hardy and obstinate men are still determined to pull down
certain ruin on their party.</p>
<p>On Thursday night Messrs. Anson and Rumbold, addressing their
numerous friends from the balcony of the Crown and Anchor, were
insulted by water thrown upon, and it is reported tiles at them,
from a small <i>red</i> inn adjoining.&nbsp; This roused the
indignation of the multitude, and the destruction of the windows
was the consequence.&nbsp; A spirited youth resented still
further indignity offered to his friends by springing from the
balcony and seizing upon and destroying the enemy&rsquo;s
blood-red standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dec. 15th.&mdash;The nomination took place at the
&ldquo;Tol-hall,&rdquo; and after the Mayor had opened the
proceedings, Col. Anson was nominated by William Barth, Esq.,
seconded by Mr. Thomas Clowes, Mr. Rumbold by John Shelly and
John Brightwen, Esqs., and A. Colville, Esq., by John Lacon,
Esq., and Mr. B. Gooch.&nbsp; The show of hands was in favour of

<p>July 11th.&mdash;The following is the account of the Burgh
Water Frolic:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Monday last being the day appointed for our
annual water frolic, an immense quantity of boats (from the
splendid pleasure barge to the humble punt) started from our
Bridge at eleven o&rsquo;clock a.m. with a favourable and
somewhat stiff breeze from the N.E.&nbsp; At two o&rsquo;clock
the various crafts laid-to in the Narrows to witness the sailing
match.&nbsp; The competitors were the Venus (cutter-rigged boat),
Last; Algerine (latteener), Craske; Emerald, (latteener) Col.
Jones; and the Hornet, Everett.&nbsp; The prize (an elegant
silver cup) was won by the Venus.&nbsp; At starting the Hornet
had the lead for a short distance, when she was passed by the
Venus, and on rounding the upper cross stake the latter boat and
the Emerald were close together, and remained so, till they got
within the Narrows, when the Colonel succeeded in passing her,
winning <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>the first by about half a minute.&nbsp; In two minutes
after the Venus recovered her lost ground and passed her
opponent, and succeeded in rounding the stake one minute before
the Emerald, who, however, neared so fast that had not the Venus
rounded the flag very closely she must have lost the match, the
Colonel being to windward.&nbsp; The oldest boater never
remembers so closely contested a run.&nbsp; After sailing, the
various crafts (which absolutely studded the river) got under
weigh, and proceeded towards the ancient Garianonum, opposite to
which they dined.&nbsp; At seven o&rsquo;clock p.m. the boats
started for home, where they arrived in about an hour, all safe,
nothing having occurred to damp the pleasures of the day, which
was an extremely fine one.&nbsp; At Burgh, Chase, the spirited
proprietor of the Neptune Gardens, was completely at home, while
on the adjacent hills, opposite the cage, various groups of happy
faces were to be seen enjoying tea, &amp;c.&nbsp; This, together
with the immense crowd of company that congregated on the road,
presented a scene that must have been witnessed to have been
fully appreciated.&nbsp; Among the company were our worthy Mayor
and a large party of fashionables in the handsome barge belonging
to W. Fisher, Esq., S. T. Berney, and J. Penrice, Esqs., in the
former&rsquo;s fast-sailing boat Meteor, Mr. Alderman Barth in
the admiral&rsquo;s (Green&rsquo;s) boat, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp;
This, together with the countless multitudes that crowded the
decks of the tug, Royal Sovereign and Emperor steamers, made the
river appear a sort of floating fair.&nbsp; On the next day a
number of boats, barges, &amp;c., sailed to the Berney Arms to
witness a rowing match (for a silver cup, given by Mr. Barnett,
the landlord of the house) by four-oared gigs, which was won by
the Wasp, a Norwich boat, belonging to William Gallant,
jun.&nbsp; Nearer home we observed an unusually large number of
stalls, &amp;c., at our bridge foot.&nbsp; On the whole, there
seemed nothing wanting to make this annual festival worthy of
brighter days, but the presence of the Corporation barge, without
which (although no brawlers against innovation) we cannot but
think the Regatta is shorn of much of its glory.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>July 18th.&mdash;A fight had taken place on the Factory Denes,
for one Sovereign, between Thomas Purdy, of Caister, commonly
known as &ldquo;The Caister Champion,&rdquo; and George Elliott,
of Ingham.&nbsp; At the 133rd round (the battle lasted 1 h. 50
min.)&nbsp; Elliott was declared the victor.</p>
<p>Two men (Seager and Hanson) had quarrelled in the Bear Tap,
when Nathaniel Lacey, in trying to part them, was knocked down
and his leg broken.</p>
<p>August 22nd.&mdash;&ldquo;As early as nine o&rsquo;clock on
Friday morning an <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>immense concourse of genteely-dressed persons had
congregated before St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, anxious not to miss
the opportunity of witnessing the solemn and imposing ceremonial
about to take place.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock the principal
door was thrown open, and this large assemblage entered.&nbsp;
The greatest order and decorum prevailed, owing certainly to the
excellent arrangement of C. Symonds, Esq., one of the
Churchwardens for the year, who, to prevent confusion, had issued
tickets, which were left at the houses of the respectable
housekeepers, without the least distinction, as also at the
various lodging houses for the use of the visitors.&nbsp; About
eleven o&rsquo;clock the Mayor (John Baker, Esq.), with the
customary regalia, attended by several other members of the
Corporate body entered the church, and were shown to the pews
appropriated for their reception.&nbsp; The Bishop of Winchester
soon arrived with his Chaplain and Registrar and proceeded up the
middle aisle to the altar, where the service began by the latter
gentleman presenting the petition to the Bishop, who redelivered
it to the Registrar, when it was by him read aloud.&nbsp; The
Right Rev. Prelate then pronounced the following words, in a
solemn, appropriate, and sonorous tone of voice&mdash;&ldquo;I am
now ready to give my full consent to that which you have desired,
and may Almighty God bless the good work in which we are about
engaging.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Lordship then, with his officers and
clergy, walked to the west end of the church and back again to
the altar, repeating alternate versicles of the 42nd Psalm.&nbsp;
The Bishop having seated himself at the table, the Deed of
Consecration was read by the surrogate (the Very Rev. the Dean of
Norwich), after which his Lordship read the exhortation, prayers,
&amp;c., appointed for the occasion.&nbsp; The usual morning
prayers were read from the desk by the Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew,
with the exception of those parts especially appropriated to the
occasion, which were read by the Bishop.&nbsp; The reading Psalms
most judiciously selected for the occasion were the 84th, 122nd,
and 132nd; the lessons, parts of the 8th chapter of 1st Kings,
and of the 10th chapter of Hebrews.&nbsp; After the prayers,
verses 6, 7, and 8 of 26th, with Gloria Patri, was performed by a
very full orchestra of instrumentalists and vocalists.&nbsp; The
common service was performed by the Bishop, with the exception of
the Epistle and the Nicene Creed, which were read by his
Lordship&rsquo;s Chaplain, the Rev. Alexander Dallas.&nbsp; The
100th Psalm (Tate and Brady&rsquo;s version) was then sung by the
whole choir.&nbsp; The sermon, a striking, apposite, and eloquent
one, was preached by the Rev. Mr. Clark, the appointed minister
of the Church, from Genesis, chapter 28th, verses 16 and
17&mdash;<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;And Jacob awaketh out of his sleep,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; [832 young persons were confirmed by the
Bishop of Winchester.]&rdquo;</p>
<p>August 29th.&mdash;The Races had been held, and on
&ldquo;Tuesday and Wednesday the great annual main of cocks had
been fought at the Bush Tavern, South Quay, between the gentlemen
of Norwich and the gentlemen of Yarmouth for &pound;5 a battle
and &pound;50 the odds, which was won by Norwich, who were six
battles a head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sept. 15th.&mdash;The smack Endeavour, of London, had been
seized with 65 casks and 16 bales (2,800 lbs. in weight) of
tobacco on board her.</p>
<p>The following Corporate officers had been chosen:&mdash;John
Danby-Palmer, Esq., Mayor; Mr. James Jay, Chamberlain; F. R.
Reynolds, Esq., and J. M. Bell, Esq., Churchwardens.</p>
<p>The late gales had caused an immense quantity of sand and
shingle to be washed into the Harbour, so as to form a point
opposite the South Pier.</p>
<p>Oct. 3rd.&mdash;The following is the report of the Yarmouth
Guild Day:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday the Mayor and the Mayor Elect (J.
Danby-Palmer, Esq.), accompanied by the Earl of Orford and the
members of the Corporation, attended divine service at St.
Nicholas&rsquo; Church, by the Hon. and Rev. Edward Pellew, after
which the Rev. Thomas Baker, Chaplain to the Body Corporate,
preached an excellent sermon.&nbsp; After service the Corporation
adjourned to the Guildhall, where the Mayor-Elect was sworn into
office with the customary ceremonies.</p>
<p>The Recorder (Mr. Sergeant Merewether) being absent, the Town
Clerk, previous to presenting the patent of appointment as Lord
High Steward of the Borough to the Earl of Orford, addressed his
Lordship, observing that the Corporation entertained a high sense
of the honour conferred upon them by his Lordship&rsquo;s
acceptance of an office which (as constituted by one of the
charters of the borough) assimilated with that of Lord High
Steward of England, an office of great power and authority,
having under the King the regulating the administration of
justice, which had not since its forfeiture in the reign of Henry
the Third, by its hereditary possessor, been granted to any one
except upon and for particular occasions, and had only been
presented to one of the Nobility and a Lord of Parliament.&nbsp;
So by the Charter of King Charles, the High Steward of the
borough of Yarmouth must be &lsquo;unus praeclarus vir,&rsquo;
the meaning of which might be gathered from the appointment of
William, Earl of Yarmouth, to be the first modern High Steward,
and <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>that
to the present time the office had been filled by noblemen
distinguished by their talents and services as statesmen, or
great naval and military commanders.&nbsp; Amongst them were the
celebrated Sir Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford, a second Robert
Earl of Orford, and George Earl of Orford, who together held that
office for nearly 60 years, much to the honour and advantage of
the Borough.&nbsp; Although their connection with that noble
family had been interrupted, it had not been forgotten by the
Corporation, who were happy in having the honour of renewing it
in the person of his Lordship, in whom they found that
&lsquo;praeclarus vir&rsquo; pointed out by the charter, and they
doubted not but that his Lordship would support them in all
transactions grounded in honour, honesty, and good faith, and
having for their object the public good, and that he would defend
and maintain their ancient rights, privileges, and
immunities.&nbsp; The Town Clerk then presented Lord Orford with
his appointment, and assured his Lordship that his presence among
them would always be hailed with pleasure by the Corporation.</p>
<p>The Earl of Orford was then sworn, and immediately addressed
the Mayor and Corporation in an eloquent speech, in which he said
he claimed no merit to himself for the choice which had been made
by the Corporation, but attributed it solely to the recollection
of the former connection of the borough with his ancestors, which
had been so handsomely alluded to by the Town Clerk, and to that
firm line of conduct in political life which he had thought it
his duty steadfastly to pursue, which it was his pride and
pleasure to maintain, and that although the Corporation might
have selected a person of more influence than himself, yet he
would yield to no one in zeal, and no exertion on his part would
be spared to uphold the rights, privileges, and immunities of the
Corporation, which had that day been entrusted to the Mayor, and
which it was to be hoped he would be permitted to resign
unimpaired to his successor.&nbsp; He himself should always feel
it his duty and pleasure to render his services available to the
true interests of the borough.</p>
<p>The other annual officers were then sworn, and the Mayor,
accompanied by the High Steward and the Corporate Body, walked to
the Town Hall, where a most splendid entertainment was provided
for upwards of three hundred and thirty gentlemen, among whom
were the Right Hon. the Earl of Orford, the Right Hon. Viscount
Nevill, the Hon. Mr. Justice Alderson, the Hon. the Rev. E.
Pellew, the Hon. P. H. Abbott, Sir E. K. Lacon, Bart.,
Vice-Admiral Sir George Parker, K.C.B., Col. Petre, Col. Mason,
Robert Marsham, Esq., J. Postle, Esq., <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Stratton Marsham, Esq., E. H. K.

Mayor and Prosperity to the Town of Yarmouth, for which the Chief
Magistrate expressed his acknowledgment, stating his
determination to do all he could to forward the best interests of
the town on every occasion.</p>
<p>On the health of Mr. Justice Alderson being given, the learned
Judge spoke of the Constitution of this country as being so
framed as to allow all who had the talents and industry to arrive
at the very highest dignities the King could confer, and
concluded by saying that the question for the people to consider
was whether they would close the avenues to those
dignities.&nbsp; The healths of Lord Nevill, Mr. Charles Palmer
(the son of the Mayor), Sir E. K. Lacon, Lord Walpole and the
House of Wolterton, Lord Wodehouse and the House of Kimberley,

and a large party adjourned to the Ball at the Bath Rooms, where
dancing continued till a late hour.</p>

<p>Oct. 31st.&mdash;&ldquo;On Monday evening last, as Mr. Marsh,
of the house of Marsh and Barnes, wine and spirit merchants, was
returning in his gig from Beccles, he overtook a female on the
road near Fritton, who, as Mr. M. passed, implored
assistance.&nbsp; He pulled up, and finding the poor creature in
an exhausted and high state of nervous excitement, and that she
was on her way to this place, he took her up, when she stated as
follows&mdash;that she had walked from Yarmouth to Heckingham
House to obtain relief for a relative residing in Yarmouth, that
she had obtained 3s., was returning home across the Marshes, and
when near the New Cut and bridge over the dam, she saw two men,
who appeared to come from a wherry, and when they met her one of
them presented a pistol and threatened to shoot her, but she
answering in the negative to the enquiry of &ldquo;Do you know
us,&rdquo; one of them said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; They <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>then searched, took from her 2s. 6d.,
some halfpence, and a handkerchief with some trifles, knocked her
down by a blow on the face, and so left her.&nbsp; When she
recovered she proceeded on her journey till the above gentleman
humanely assisted her into the town and relieved her; but she was
so weak from the fright as to stagger when she left the
gig.&nbsp; She states that she thinks she could recognize one of
the men.&nbsp; Might not some enquiry as to what wherry was
moored in the Cut at that time lead to the detection of the
perpetrators of so diabolical an act as that of distressing the
distressed.&nbsp; We respectfully submit to the gentlemen who are
the guardians for the hundred of Heckingham if some safe plan
could not be devised to relieve non-resident paupers, so as to
obviate the necessity of a journey by them of so many
miles.&rdquo;</p>

below the knee, applied to Mr. W. B. Neslen, shoe and last maker,
of this town, complaining of the inconvenience she experienced
from the wooden substitute she had procured.&nbsp; Mr. N.
immediately set about remedying this, which he eventually
accomplished by the making of a leg, which for useful purposes
has in a very great measure supplied the loss of the original
limb.&nbsp; It was composed of light sycamore wood, cased with
leather, with elastic springs for the foot.&nbsp; It was shown to
several mechanics in the neighbourhood, who all gave an opinion
highly favourable to the ingenuity of its construction.&nbsp; It
weighs 3lbs. (the former substitute weighed 7lbs.) and is
connected <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>with the knee by springs.&nbsp; The lady is enabled to
make very nearly the same use of the artificial as she previously
had done with the real limb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oct. 2nd.&mdash;Contains the following report of the
proceedings on the &ldquo;Mayor&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Monday being the feast of St. Michael, the day was
ushered in by ringing of Bells, flags at the New Hall, Church,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The Mayor-Elect (I. Preston, jun., Esq.) ordered
twopenny buns to be given to the children of the different
charity schools in the town, and it was really gratifying to
observe the number of happy boys and girls, with cheers parading
Gaol-street, the Quay, &amp;c., with their gifts in their
hands.&nbsp; About two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the Mayor
and Corporation attended divine service at St. Nicholas&rsquo;
Church, where a sermon was delivered by the Rev. F. Baker (son of
the Rector of Rollesby) from Acts, chapter 23rd, 4th and 5th
verses, which in the days when passive obedience and
non-resistance reigned might have been considered an excellent
one.&nbsp; Happily, however, those days are past, and few,
probably, of the rev. <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>gentleman&rsquo;s hearers accorded
with him when they heard him denounce from the pulpit the great
majority of those who sought Reform in the Church, and other
acknowledged abuses as infidels, atheists, and anarchists, and
those who aimed at the overthrow of the Church, the Altar, and
the Crown.&nbsp; From the Church the Corporation proceeded to the
Guildhall, where the Mayor-Elect (after having taken the oath of
office) spoke to the following effect:&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen,
previous to assuming the chair of Chief Magistracy, which I am
about to fill, you will allow me to thank you for the proof that
you have given me of your confidence.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I sought
not this office; I have accepted it only that I might endeavour
to render myself useful to my fellow townsmen.&nbsp; Gentlemen,
it is not the pageantry, the sword and mace (though even these
may be of use in their way) that have allured me to this
office&mdash;no; had I been capable of being actuated by such
motives, I should have been indeed unworthy of taking (as I have
just taken) the Holy Gospels in my hand, and to have sworn before
my God, to execute to the best of my ability, the important
duties of Chief Magistrate of my native town.&nbsp; I would now
address myself to my proper brethren, I would address myself to
all, high or low, rich or poor, and exhort them to do all that in
their power lie to promote the decorum of social life, by
cheeking vice, immorality, and debauchery.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I
thank you very much for the patience with which you have heard
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This address was delivered with much firmness,
and at the same time with considerable emotion, and was received
with great applause.&nbsp; After the ceremony of robing, and the
other routine business had been gone through, the newly-elected
Mayor, Deputy-Mayor, &amp;c., proceeded (escorted by the town
band, flags, &amp;c.) to the New Hall, where a sumptuous dinner
was served to a numerous and highly respectable assembly of the
Body Corporate, and the friends of the Chief Magistrate.&nbsp;
The dessert, which was fine and abundant, was, we understand,
served by Mr. Brooks, of the Market Row.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct. 9th.&mdash;Harry Worship, Esq., had delivered a very
interesting lecture on the &ldquo;Philosophy of
Dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oct. 16th.&mdash;The frequency of robbery at sea had induced
the fishermen to keep an unusually sharp look out.</p>
<p>Oct. 23rd.&mdash;Charles J. Palmer, Esq., had been elected an
Alderman in the place of Dr. Bateman, deceased.</p>
<p>It appears from the report of the proceedings at the Revision
Court that the lower ferry was then let at &pound;30 a year
only.</p>
<p>Oct. 30th.&mdash;The &ldquo;Blues&rdquo; claimed a gain of 50
on the revision of the Freeman&rsquo;s list.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>The
fishing was reported as going on &ldquo;very badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nov. 6th.&mdash;A public meeting had been held on the subject
of the Port and Haven Bill, the Mayor in the chair, when Messrs.
George Danby Palmer, Shelly, Brightwen, Ferrier, Barth, and
Dowson took part in the proceedings.</p>
<p>Nov. 20th.&mdash;The Conservatives had held a meeting at
Bammant&rsquo;s Green, Mr. William Mabson in the chair, pledging
themselves to support the Hon. W. H. Beresford and W. M.
Praed.</p>

in Regent Street, when Messrs. George Steward and J. Shelly took
part in the proceedings.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Political Union&rdquo; required Col. Anson and Mr.
Rumbold to pledge themselves to support &ldquo;Corporation
Reform, Triennial Parliaments, Extension of the Suffrage, and
Vote by Ballot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dec. 4th.&mdash;A meeting of voters in the Blue interest had
been held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, when it was determined
&ldquo;to sink all minor differences&rdquo; in order to secure
the return of Col. Anson and Mr. Rumbold.&nbsp; Mr. N. B. Palmer
addressed a crowded assembly from the Committee Rooms.</p>
<p>Dec. 11th.&mdash;Thomas Baring, Esq., had arrived as Mr.
Praed&rsquo;s colleague, and both gentlemen had addressed the
electors from the Newcastle Tavern, and a house on the South
Quay, which they had engaged as a Committee Room.</p>
<p>Dec. 18th.&mdash;The contest was progressing, Col. Anson
assuring his supporters &ldquo;that at that moment their
canvassing book stood better than he had ever known it to stand
since he had known Yarmouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dec. 23rd.&mdash;There had been a &ldquo;violent
scuffle&rdquo; between the Reds and the Blues, during which
&ldquo;the son of a Baronet was pulled from his horse and beaten
violently.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>1835.</h3>
<p>Jan. 8th, contains the following account of the
election:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is with feelings of the deepest sorrow
that we announce that our late members, Messrs. Anson and
Rumbold, are ousted from the representation.&nbsp; We said last
week that nothing but the most gross and unblushing bribery could
possibly unseat these gentlemen, and these means have been had
recourse to, to an unprecedented extent.&nbsp; Messrs. Baring and
Praed are returned, not by the free and independent voice of the
people, but by a bought majority, bought by means most
disgraceful both to <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>giver and receiver, although we cannot help thinking
that the larger portion of disgrace attaches to the
former&mdash;for what can be more discreditable, what can be more
contrary to the high honour which ought to distinguish the
gentleman, than to take advantage of the poor freeman, and by (in
this instance doubly accursed) gold to make him forfeit his
solemn promises?&nbsp; Do our opponents ask for proofs of
this?&nbsp; We have them in the infamous system of cooping (a
system which we had hoped was confined to a neighbouring city,
but which has been now imported into this till now uncorrupt
borough), which has been with a bold unblushing front carried on
to a large extent in certain houses in the town.&nbsp; We have
them in the number of freemen who were to be seen on both
election days coming up to the Red booth with Blue colours in
their hats, and in the madness of infuriating drink, flinging
them in the face of and grossly abusing a highly respected and
respectable fellow townsman of ours, while at the same time they
recorded their votes for Messrs. Baring and Praed.&nbsp; We have
it in the fact that four sovereigns, with a promise of as much
more, and &pound;2 10s., with a like promise, were given to two
poor freemen of the names of Boyce and Stevenson, to induce them
to vote for the Reds, but who, with a truly noble spirit that
cannot be too highly appreciated, brought the money into their
hands to the Blue booth, and then polled for Messrs. Anson and
Rumbold.&nbsp; But, unfortunately for the good cause, these
glorious examples were not generally followed.&nbsp; The Red
Leaders took good care for the most part of their deluded and
purchased victims, by plying them with drink, keeping them in
strong hold, &amp;c., to allow them to return to the paths of
rectitude.&nbsp; We do think that the feelings of our late
members are rather to be envied by those of the present, the
former having lost with honour, the latter owing their election
not to the feeling of the town (that we confidently say, without
fear of contradiction, is with Messrs. Anson and Rumbold), but to
the exercise of the most abominable and venal means to effectuate
it.&nbsp; If anything like the sums which we have heard mentioned
have been expended in this shameful warfare of gold against
principle, our opponents may truly say with one of yore,
&lsquo;another such victory will ruin us!&rsquo;&nbsp; The most
active measures are being had recourse to (and may they be
successful) either by substantiating the individual instances of
bribery, which we know have to a great extent taken place to oust
the members from those seats which they so unjustly obtained by
bad means, manifestly against the feeling and real wishes of the
town to oust Messrs. Baring and Praed from the ill-earned honours
so surreptitiously procured <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>for them, or at any rate to make the
guilty individual perpetrators pay the penalty of such
acts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nomination of the candidates took place at the
Guildhall, on hustings erected outside.&nbsp; The Town Clerk (S.
Tolver, Esq.) having read the precept, the Mayor, in a loud
voice, requested a patient hearing for those who might address
them.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Barth, in a neat speech, proposed the
Hon. Col Anson as a fit and proper person to represent the
borough.&nbsp; B. Dowson, Esq., seconded the nomination.&nbsp;
Vice-Admiral Sir G. Parker, K.C.B., in a very manly and
straightforward speech, proposed Mr. Rumbold, when Mr. Shelly
presented himself as the seconder.&nbsp; A picked party of his
opponents, evidently brought there for the purpose, attempted by
every discordant noise to prevent his being heard; by dint of
perseverance, however, and the powerful support of his numerous
friends, Mr. S. with even more than his usual eloquence, at
considerable length supported the nomination.&nbsp; Messrs. R.
Ferrier and A. Palmer proposed and seconded Mr. Baring, and Mr.
J. Penrice proposed and Mr. J. Lacon seconded the nomination of
Mr. Praed.&nbsp; The Hon. Col. Anson spoke at great length, and
with all his wonted power, in the course of a really luminous
speech, he expressed the surprise he had felt on finding Mr. A.
Palmer (a gentleman who had before honoured him with his support)
among the ranks of his opponents.&nbsp; Mr. P. explained by
saying it was because Col. A. had allied himself to Radicals and
destructives.&nbsp; The Hon. Col. said he was surprised at having
such a reason assigned.&nbsp; It was known to all that he had
never succumbed to the Radicals.&nbsp; That deeply grateful as he
was for their support, he had, and should again, unless convinced
of their necessity, oppose their great measures of vote by ballot
and triennial parliaments.&nbsp; That he was so far independent
appeared in this, that with the ballot he believed the present
opposition would scarcely have occurred, or if it had it would
have been but a very few hours ere it would have terminated in
the triumph of himself and Mr. Rumbold.&nbsp; (Loud
cheers.)&nbsp; The other candidates also addressed the assembled
multitude.&nbsp; The poll commenced the following day, and from
the activity with the Pink and Purples, or Reds, or
Conservatives, for in the motley assemblage of coalition of
colours we scarcely know what exactly they call themselves,
brought up their voters, it was feared that they would head the
first day&rsquo;s poll.&nbsp; The event proved the correctness of
the prediction, for at four o&rsquo;clock it was found that the
Tories had a majority of 192; although the Blues rallied next
morning, that majority could not <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>be altogether overcome.&nbsp; The
final close of the poll left Messrs. Baring and Praed a majority
of 88.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Col. Anson and Mr. Rumbold addressed an
immense concourse of persons, by whom they were repeatedly and
loudly cheered, from the King&rsquo;s Head windows.&nbsp; They
were preceded by Mr. Alderman Barth, Col. Anson&rsquo;s very deep
emotion not enabling him immediately to come forward.&nbsp; When
he did come forward he said no language which he could use could
sufficiently express his sorrow at the dissolution of the
connection so long subsisting between them; their present members
would find their task a comparatively easy one; they would find
that such attention had been paid to the town that the path would
be plain before them, and that little indeed would remain to be
done.&nbsp; (Loud cheers.)&nbsp; They had been defeated by means
most flagitious.&nbsp; Let not the present members, however, be
too certain of their seats, for if by any means these foul
proceedings could be sifted to the bottom, measures would be
taken to remove them from their ill-acquired honours.&nbsp; With
him and Mr. Rumbold, he was happy to say, still remained the real
voice of the people.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp; He was proud of this,
and would in conclusion assure them that whether in or out of
Parliament their interests would ever have a prominent place in
his regards.&nbsp; (Loud cheers.)&nbsp; Mr. Rumbold spoke under
the influence of great agitation, and in the course of a very
luminous speech adverted to the disgraceful fact of having in his
pocket a proof that, in a room in this town a bribe was offered
in the presence and with the cognizance of a Magistrate.&nbsp;
(Cries of &lsquo;Shame, shame.&rsquo;)&nbsp; He should carry into
retirement with him the deepest sense of their uniform kindness,
and a determination ever to forward the interests of any of his
former constituents, who might apply to him, to the best of his
ability.&nbsp; The chairing of to-day was hailed by numbers with
demonstrations which must have been the very reverse to the
members; indeed, we are sure that if the Blues had shown in full
strength their exasperated feelings (and they did not do this
alone in compliance with the advice of their leaders), there
could have been no chairing.&nbsp; A dinner of our late
members&rsquo; friends is now about taking place at the Masonic
Hall, very numerously attended.&nbsp; A subscription for the
purchase of a piece of plate for them is commenced, and will
include the smallest amount.&nbsp; This will confirm us in our
conviction that the sense of the town is with the
Blues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Feb. 12th contains the following account of a sailing match
from Yarmouth to Venice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lion, Punchard, having some time been
considered the fastest ship out of this port, a brig was built,
and launched in the middle of September, called the Vivid
(Captain M. Butcher, jun.) and matched against the Lion, for
Venice, which vessel sailed at 3 p.m. on the 2nd of December, and
the Vivid sailed at 6 p.m. on the following day, being 27 hours
difference in favour of the former vessel; since which period
letters have been received from Venice from each Captain, stating
that the Vivid passed the Gut of Gibraltar on the 22nd of
December and the Lion on the 29th.&nbsp; They also state that the
Vivid arrived at Venice on the 17th ult, and the Lion on the 24th
ult.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A meeting of the subscribers to the plate to be presented to
the late M.P.&rsquo;s (Messrs. Anson and Rumbold) had been held,
when it appeared that 3,685 persons had contributed &pound;370

Star Hotel, when G. Danby Palmer, Esq., moved that a petition
should be presented in favour of the Corporation Reform Bill.</p>
<p>June 25th.&mdash;Another meeting on the same subject had been
held at the Mechanics&rsquo; Hall.&nbsp; Messrs. William Barth,
R. Wall, Thomas Hammond, E. Sewell, S. Cobb, and J. Shelly taking
part in the proceedings.</p>
<p>July 2nd.&mdash;Mr. Praed had presented a petition against the
Corporation Reform Bill from the town.</p>
<p>July 30th.&mdash;The following notice appears of the death of
J. Shelly, Esq.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is with feelings of more than ordinary
regret that we this week announce the sudden death of John
Shelly, Esq.&nbsp; This estimable gentleman had concluded his
examination on Tuesday forenoon last before the Parliamentary
Committee, and after being highly complimented by the noble
Chairman (Lord F. Egerton) for his ability (feeling himself
somewhat unwell), had retired to his inn, where he directed the
waiter to call him in half-an-hour.&nbsp; The servant went
upstairs at the time appointed, about two in the afternoon, and
found Mr. S. sitting in a chair, nearly dead.&nbsp; We repeat
that we feel more than ordinary regret at having this
announcement to make.&nbsp; As a leader and representative (if we
may so say) of a party his death will create a void that it will
be long indeed ere it be filled.&nbsp; His was a master
mind&mdash;once embarked in a subject (whatever might be its
magnitude) it was sure to be treated powerfully and ably by Mr.
Shelly, the whole energies of whose mind were directed to <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>its
elucidation for the benefit of his fellow townsmen.&nbsp; There
might, indeed, be those who excelled this really gifted man in
some particular department, but for general knowledge, facility,
power, ease, and even elegance of expression, our lamented
friend, we should say, has not left his equal in this, his native
town.&nbsp; That he was a warm partizan, no one can deny, but
that he was directed in his every movement of a public nature by
sincerity and conscience is equally clear to every one who had
the happiness of knowing him.&nbsp; The great majority of the
shops kept by those in the Liberal interest are shaded, to show
the sense which is entertained of the irreparable nature of the
public loss sustained.&nbsp; But it is not alone in public that
the work of Mr. S. was known.&nbsp; As a father, husband, friend,
and Christian, his conduct was alike exemplary.&nbsp; We will
venture to say that, warm as was his political partizanship, he
never made himself one personal enemy.&nbsp; Mr. Shelly has left
an amiable wife and eleven children to deplore his
loss.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>August 8th.&mdash;The Regatta had been held, when the cup was
won by Sir Jacob Preston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Maria&rdquo;; on this
occasion Edmund Preston, Esq., entertained &ldquo;about 200 of
the fashionables of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>August 13th.&mdash;The petition in favour of Corporation
Reform had been signed by 2,500 persons.</p>
<p>August 20th.&mdash;The following notice appears:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Friday night, Mr. Prentice, of whose
contumacy before a Committee of the House of Commons our readers
have heard so much, arrived here, having been recently released
from Newgate.&nbsp; The day previous handbills made their
appearance, inviting the friends of Messrs. Baring and Praed to
accompany Prentice into town.&nbsp; About seven o&rsquo;clock on
the first-mentioned evening a party of from twenty to thirty left
the house of a publican in Chapel Street, preceded with band,
colours, and banners down Regent Street, over the bridge, and so
on to Hopton.&nbsp; On the arrival of the &ldquo;Morning
Star&rdquo; coach Prentice was taken out and placed in an open
landau, in which he stood upright, bowing, as he went along, to
the assemblage, which by this time had become very large, induced
thereto by the novelty of the scene.&nbsp; The procession with
much mock gravity moved on to the bridge, by torch light, went
round the town, and thence proceeded to the Bowling Green, where
the lion of the night spoke from a window.&nbsp; He described the
present as the proudest, the happiest day of his life&mdash;said
that although the Reform Bill had given him a vote, yet he hated
it,&mdash;he hated also the Corporation Reform Bill, and hoped
that the Lords would so mutilate it that Lord John <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Russell might
not know his own child again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>October 8th contains the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some admirers of the Corporation met on
Tuesday sen&rsquo;night to celebrate Michaelmas Day at the Angel
Inn, Mr. F. Paget in the chair.&nbsp; We understand that some of
the leading members of the expiring body were present.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>October 18th contains a notice of Brock&rsquo;s miraculous
escape from drowning.</p>
<p>Oct. 22nd.&mdash;The first Oddfellows&rsquo; funeral in this
town is thus recorded:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Thursday afternoon last the novel
ceremonial of an Oddfellows&rsquo; funeral took place in
processional order.&nbsp; The deceased, Nathaniel Spilman, had
been for many years a member of the two lodges in this town, and,
it having been his request, he was interred with the usual
honours appertaining to the Order.&nbsp; Accordingly, the
brethren of the two lodges proceeded in the following order to
the house of the deceased:&mdash;officer of the lodge with his
drawn sword, secretary bearing the scroll, two officers with
their wands, two of the head officers of each lodge, two officers
with wands, two of the second officers of the lodges, a large
concourse of the brethren adorned with their numerous silver
medals, aprons, &amp;c., two of the wardens carrying their
badges.&nbsp; On their arrival at the house they proceeded to the
churchyard in the above order, with the addition of the Hon. and
Rev. Edward Pellew preceding the body, which was carried by six
of the brethren of the lodge, with six others as pall-holders,
wearing their different medals and aprons.&nbsp; When at the
grave the Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew read the burial service, and at
the conclusion the scroll was thrown in, each of the brethren
throwing in sprigs of rosemary.&nbsp; The secretary to both
lodges read the funeral obsequies over the grave.&nbsp; They then
returned to the house of the deceased&rsquo;s relatives, and
after leaving the family (who had attended the remains to the
grave) proceeded in the same order to the lodge-room, where they
soon after separated.&nbsp; Certainly nothing could have been
more solemn and impressive than was the whole of this
ceremonial.&nbsp; At a meeting of the brethren on the Monday
following, it was unanimously resolved, that the secretary should
issue a circular to the Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew, thanking him for
the great condescension and kindness evinced by him in attending
the funeral of their late departed brother.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>It is a matter of great congratulation that 34 out
of the 36 Councillors are Reformers.&nbsp; This election was
conducted with tranquility.&nbsp; Devoutly it is to be wished
that parliamentary elections were managed in the same way.&nbsp;
The laborious portion of our population had no inducement held
out to them to lose a single hour.&nbsp; It is a little curious
that Mr. William Prentice&mdash;that very Mr. Prentice who made
so conspicuous a figure in our election parliamentary
investigation, proved one of the most formidable antagonists with
whom the Liberal candidates in the town had to
contend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Jan.
7th.&mdash;The first meeting of the Reformed Corporation is
reported as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Town Council met on Thursday last at
the Tolhouse Hall, John Brightwen, Esq., in the chair, (Isaac
Preston, Esq., having, we understand, ceased to exercise the
functions of Mayor since his publication of the Council List),
for the purpose of choosing twelve Aldermen.&nbsp; The choice
fell on the following gentlemen:&mdash;Messrs. J. Brightwen,
Benjamin Dowson, Robert Teasdel, Joseph Starling, J. B. Palmer,
R. S. Lonsdale, Thomas Pitt, Captain William Larke, R.N.,
Benjamin Fenn, Robert Wall, Christopher Nicholls, and Captain
James Jefferies.&nbsp; On the following day the Aldermen and
Council met at the same place for the election of a Mayor and for
other public business.&nbsp; Mr. E. H. L. Preston proposed Mr.
Richard Hammond.&nbsp; Mr. H. thanked Mr. P. for the proposition,
and said that he should still more thank his friends if they
voted against him.&nbsp; William Barth, Esq., was then chosen
Mayor, amidst loud cheering.&nbsp; Mr. B. was then, together with
the Aldermen, sworn in.&nbsp; The Court was then thrown open to
the public, when the front and side galleries were instantly
filled by a very respectable concourse of persons, the body of
the hall being appropriated to the Council.&nbsp; Several
gentlemen were named for Magistrates to be recommended to the
Crown.&nbsp; Accounts were ordered touching the property (and
profits arising from such property) held by the late Corporation,
together with accounts of the official persons employed, their
salaries, &amp;c., for the last five years.&nbsp; J. Tolver,
Esq., was then chosen, during pleasure, as Town Clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Conservatives had dined together on Thursday to
celebrate the anniversary of the return of Messrs. Baring and
Praed.&nbsp; They have been obliged to put themselves on a level
with the Reformers, and be content with three shilling tickets
instead of fifteen.&nbsp; The dinner took place at the Angel Inn,
J. E. Lacon, Esq., in the chair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jan. 14th contains the following report:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was an unusual quantity of business
transacted at the Corporation Assembly on Wednesday last.&nbsp;
It was first proposed that a petition should be addressed to the
King, praying for four Sessions of Oyer and Terminer a
year.&nbsp; It was suggested that the Recorder should be allowed
&pound;60 a year.&nbsp; To this Mr. E. L. Preston objected, who
moved that it should be &pound;50.&nbsp; To this it was replied
that the latter sum was allowed by the late Corporation when
Sessions were only held twice a year.&nbsp; The original motion
was carried unanimously, Mr. E. Sewell <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>observing that Mr. P&rsquo;s was a
false economy.&nbsp; It was next moved by Mr. S. Cobb that the
Great Seal should be called that of the Town Council, and not of
St. Nicholas.&nbsp; He had no objection to all remaining as it
was except the expensive name of St. Nicholas.&nbsp; This was
warmly opposed by Mr. Preston.&nbsp; It was, however, carried
unanimously.&nbsp; Mr. Richard Hammond read a list of persons to
form the Committee of Finance.&nbsp; To this plan Mr. Preston
warmly objected, saying he had no notion of names being got up
&ldquo;ready cut and dried.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was stated in answer
that the list (to which no objection was then made) was agreed to
at the Watch Committee, of which Mr. P. formed one, and which he
might have attended if he pleased.&nbsp; Mr. B. Sherrington (of
the same politics as Mr. P.) was on the Committee, and was
present.&nbsp; The Finance Committee agreed to were, the Mayor
(who is appointed <i>ex-officio</i> on all Committees), Messrs.
S. Cobb, R. S. Lonsdale, Charles Nicholls, B. Dowson, Martin, G.
D. Palmer, C. Sayers, W. Johnson, and Burroughs.&nbsp; On the
Mayor explaining the duties of the Borough Lands Committee, it
was suggested and agreed to, that the tradesmen employed solely
by this Committee should be only for small jobs.&nbsp; This being
a most important business, it was determined that all the Council
should form the Committee.&nbsp; On the Water-Bailiffs and Met
Farm Office Committee, it was resolved, on the motion of Mr. S.
Cobb, that it be called &ldquo;Committee of Port Dues&rdquo;; the
officer &ldquo;Collector of Port Dues.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Committee
appointed were Messrs. W. Barber, G. D. Palmer, T. Pitt, R.
Teasdel, Martin, J. B. Palmer, Thomas Hammond, Fenn, Butcher, and
Dowson.&nbsp; Market and Corporation Tolls&rsquo; Committee:
Messrs. Johnson, Brightwen, S. Cobb, Sayers, Nicholls,
Sherrington, R. Hammond, S. Palmer, Symonds, J. B. Palmer, and
Martin.&nbsp; Committee for Caister Causeway: Messrs. R. P. Kemp,
S. Palmer, Nicholls, Fenn, Tomlinson, R. Hammond, and
Sayers.&nbsp; Church Trustees: Messrs. Larke, Kemp, Burroughs, J.
Dowson, Starling, B. Cobb, S. Palmer, E. N. Clowes, Marsh,
Tomlinson, Garson, Grave, Butcher, Barber, Robinson, Preston,
Martin, Symonds, Sherrington, and G. D. Palmer.&nbsp; All the
outstanding drawbacks arc to be referred to the Port Dues
Committee.&nbsp; The ringers&rsquo; bill, &pound;12 10s. for five
days&rsquo; ringing, was disallowed.&nbsp; Admiralty Court: R.
Cory, jun., returned that he had in five years received as
registrar &pound;1,483 16s. 8d., and claimed as compensation
&pound;200 per year for his natural life.&nbsp; Proctors: C. J.
Palmer claimed &pound;1,036 7s., C. Sayers &pound;1,196 5s. 6d.,
I. Preston &pound;692, E. R. Palmer &pound;497.&nbsp; Thomas
King, gaoler, petitioned for continuance of place, stated
emoluments, and asked <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>&pound;13 7s. 4&frac12;d.
compensation, as Marshall of the Court of Admiralty.&nbsp; Mrs.
King, as matron, received &pound;10 per year, and prayed to be
continued.&nbsp; Alfred King, turnkey, received 14s. per. week,
and prayed for continuance.&nbsp; The five sergeants-at-mace sent
a return of their emoluments for five years, and petitioned for
their continuance.&nbsp; B. Welsh, chapel clerk, made about
&pound;47 per year, and prayed for continuance.&nbsp; The Rev.
Thomas Baker, as lecturer, received &pound;120 per year.&nbsp;
The Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew received from the late Corporation
&pound;40 per year and a house, for which he pays 1s. per year
rent.&nbsp; John Seaman, parish clerk, receives no salary, but
averages about &pound;80 per annum.&nbsp; The Revs. J. Homfray
and Mark Waters declined the statement of their proceeds, as they
conceived the returns did not apply to them as Ministers of a
Chapel endowed by Act of Parliament.&nbsp; They begged their
refusal might not be considered as arising from
discourtesy.&nbsp; Their communication was rejected.&nbsp; These
returns were referred to a Committee of the Mayor&rsquo;s
assistants.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jan. 21st.&mdash;The Earl of Orford had been removed from his
office of High Steward and the Earl of Lichfield elected in his

Magistrates:&mdash;William Barth, Esq., Sir George Parker,
K.C.B., George Danby Palmer, H. V. Worship, J. Brightwen, C.

honour of Messrs. Baring and Praed.&nbsp; Seven hundred persons
attended.</p>
<p>Feb. 18th.&mdash;Has the following report of a high
tide:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The scene of devastation on our beach,
occasioned by the late high tides, exceed the powers of
description.&nbsp; Wednesday morning, in some measure, prepared
us for the event; the sea was at that time breaking over the
jetty, and reached as high as the houses.&nbsp; It was prophesied
by nautical men that if the next tide was equally high the
consequences would be most disastrous, and, unfortunately, it so
proved.&nbsp; The sea in the evening undermined the foundations
of most of the dwellings, throwing down the walls of many, to the
great injury of those of the inmates who had not taken the
precautions to remove their property.&nbsp; Furniture was seen
floating in all directions, in the presence of the astonished and
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>alarmed
multitude.&nbsp; The summer residence of the Right Hon. Lord
Berners is more than half destroyed, while the house of the
Misses Ansell and the Right Hon. Lord Nevill were surrounded; in
fact, such a scene of general devastation never in the memory of
the oldest inhabitant presented itself.&nbsp; The sea at one time
reached some way up the Jetty Road.&nbsp; While a person was
assisting the landlord of the Holkham Tavern to remove his beds,
&amp;c., to a back warehouse, the sea burst in and broke down the
front wall.&nbsp; At one part of the South Denes the sea and
river might be seen meeting.&nbsp; Part of the South Quay was
flooded.&nbsp; It was unusually high at the bridge, and likewise
some of the lower parts of the town.&nbsp; Amidst this wide
spreading destruction, we are glad to say, no lives were
lost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feb. 22nd.&mdash;The Lord High Steward (the Earl of Lichfield)
had been sworn in, and a dinner given in his honour.&nbsp; The
noble lord was accompanied by the Mayor, Lord Suffield, the Hon.
George Anson, Mr. Rumbold, Sir W. Ffolkes, and Mr. Adair.</p>
<p>March 10th.&mdash;A meeting had been held, the Hon. and Rev.
E. Pellew presiding, to consider the establishment of a penny
library for the working classes.</p>
<p>March 24th.&mdash;A bet had been made by Mr. Ringer, of the
Elephant and Castle liquor shop in the Market Place, &ldquo;that
on Monday he would sell 1,000 glasses of ale and porter from six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning and close the same night.&nbsp; Mr.
R. closed at 10, after selling 2,454, at one penny per
glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. F. Preston had launched a fine ship of 370 tons from his
yard.</p>
<p>April 2nd.&mdash;Mr. Edward H. L. Preston and Mr. Green had
been tried and acquitted upon charges of bribery alleged to have
been committed by them at the General Election, when Messrs.
Baring and Praed were returned for the borough.</p>

Commissioners, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>and Messrs. Palmer and Barth were consequently elected.</p>
<p>April 14th contains the following paragraph as to the recent
bribery prosecution:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yesterday there was a grand public dinner
at the Angel Inn, to <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>celebrate what the Tories call
&lsquo;the defeat of the Attorney-General and the Yarmouth
Radicals;&rsquo; but what we should say was a fortunate escape of
the accused parties, arising from the glorious uncertainty of the
law.&nbsp; John Lacon, Esq., was in the chair.&nbsp; Richard
Ferrier, Esq., presided at the left hand table.&nbsp; The two
vice-presidents were Mr. Aldred and Mr. John Clarke.&nbsp; A very
handsome silver teapot and ewer were presented to Mr. William
Green, by John Penrice, Esq., in an appropriate speech, for his
exertions at the last election.&nbsp; We were not present, but
had these particulars from a Tory friend, who also said &lsquo;he
thought &rsquo;twas hard poor Prentice hadn&rsquo;t something, as
he did as much as Green, and more too.&rsquo;&nbsp; There were
about 70 persons present.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty gentlemen, all of Reform principles, had been elected
select Vestrymen.</p>
<p>Five hundred merchants and others had attended a public
meeting to protest against the proposal of the Eastern
Counties&rsquo; Railway Company to construct a line to
Harwich.</p>
<p>April 28th.&mdash;The seamen had &ldquo;struck&rdquo; for an
increase of wages.</p>
<p>Several persons had been fined for keeping disorderly
houses.</p>
<p>Seven vessels had been cleared with emigrants for America,
carrying 850 adults and 600 children, and several other vessels
were fitting out for the same voyage.</p>
<p>May 5th.&mdash;The town was suffering from a number of dogs
prowling about, one of which had severely bitten a young
lady.</p>
<p>May 19th.&mdash;Mr. William Ferrier had been elected Coroner
by the Council, which body had voted, by a majority of one, to
retain the Market Cross.</p>
<p>June 9th&mdash;Mr. Jefferies Barth had been elected Clerk of
the Peace.</p>
<p>June 17th.&mdash;Nathaniel Palmer, Esq., had been appointed
Recorder.</p>
<p>June 23rd.&mdash;A fine new schooner (The Clipper) had been
launched for William Hurry Palmer, Esq., and was expected to be
the fastest sailing vessel out of the port.</p>
<p>June 30th.&mdash;The Cross was ordered to be pulled down.</p>
<p>July 14th.&mdash;It was stated that &ldquo;Yarmouth is very
full of strangers, who flock here from all parts of the country
to enjoy the cool sea breezes.&nbsp; We believe there is not any
other place that affords so excellent a view of shipping in
motion as Yarmouth Roads, it being the great thoroughfare for all
vessels trading to the North.&nbsp; The Bath Room is one of the
principal attractions to visitors, as it is a most agreeable
lounge during the heat of the day, and frequent undress balls
enliven the youthful part <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of the company.&nbsp; The Bath Room
has been well attended this year, and we are happy to say the
list of subscribers gives promise of a good season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The destruction of the Cross is thus noticed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Friday last the Market Cross was sold by
public tender for &pound;55 6s., and on Monday morning workmen
commenced pulling it down.&nbsp; It has now entirely disappeared,
to the gratification of the residents in the Market Place, to
whom it had long been a great annoyance, in consequence of its
having become a rendezvous for idle and dissolute persons.&nbsp;
The Tories lament the loss of it, and call the Corporation
destructives for having removed a public nuisance!&nbsp; We know
not what claim it had upon their sympathies, except in being a
fit emblem of the late Body Corporate, for like that it perhaps
was of service at some bygone period of time, but having long
ceased to be useful, it had fallen to abuse and rottenness, and
to complete the resemblance it has, after some struggles, been
swept away by the current of public opinion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>August 9th.&mdash;The Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew had been
presented with plate of the value of &pound;100 by the
parishioners.</p>
<p>August 25th.&mdash;The Races had been held, the Stewards being
the Earl of Orford, Lord Henniker, and T. Baring, Esq.,
M.P.&nbsp; About 160 ladies and gentlemen attended the Race Ball,
and 2,000 persons patronized the Vauxhall Gardens.</p>
<p>Sept. 1st.&mdash;The Regatta had been held, and the Theatre
had been well filled on the Stewards&rsquo; bespeak, when an
attempt to get up a cry of &ldquo;Baring and Rumbold&rdquo;
proved a failure.</p>
<p>Sept. 22nd.&mdash;172 persons holding Corporation leaseholds
had intimated their desire to purchase the freehold of their
properties, at prices amounting to &pound;6,911.</p>
<p>Oct. 6th.&mdash;The price of herrings was &pound;23 to
&pound;24 per last.</p>
<p>Oct. 13th.&mdash;The compensation awarded to the Town Clerk
for loss of his offices of Magistrates&rsquo; Clerk and Clerk of
the Peace had been settled at &pound;222 per annum.</p>
<p>Nov. 3rd.&mdash;The result of the Municipal Election is
reported as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our Municipal Election took place on
Tuesday last.&nbsp; The contest in the St. Nicholas&rsquo; Ward
was a severe one.&nbsp; It was neck and neck between Mr. Nuthall
and E. H. L. Preston all day.&nbsp; At length the election was
carried by a <i>worthy</i>, who, after promising constantly to
vote for Nuthall and Sherrington, was suddenly not to be found;
but about five <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>minutes before the close of the poll he was brought out
of the Saracen&rsquo;s Head, a low public-house, in a state of
intoxication, his voting paper having been changed or altered to
Preston and Fiddes.&nbsp; This decided the thing in Mr.
Preston&rsquo;s favour, as before that time the numbers for him
and Mr. Nuthall were 102 each.&nbsp; Such a mode of gaining an
election is quite in keeping with Tory practices, and needs no
comment.&nbsp; The validity of the election is, however, disputed
on the grounds of a bad vote on the Tory side, and an informality
in the appointment of an Alderman to preside in the absence of
the Aldermen of the Ward.&nbsp; The following is a list of
Councillors returned:&mdash;<i>St. Nicholas&rsquo; Ward</i>: Mr.
Sherrington and Mr. Preston.&nbsp; <i>Market</i>: Mr. E. N.
Clowes and Mr. Sewell.&nbsp; <i>Regent</i>: Mr. Cufaude Davie and
Mr. John Fish.&nbsp; <i>St. George&rsquo;s</i>: Mr. Worship and
Mr. Lettis.&nbsp; <i>Nelson</i>: Mr. Robinson and Mr.
Symonds.&nbsp; <i>St. Andrew&rsquo;s</i>: Mr. Martin and Mr.
Frederick Preston.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>1838.</h3>
<p>April 19th.&mdash;Winter had come again, and the frost had
blocked up several pumps.&nbsp; The nights were extremely dark,
and great complaints had been made by inhabitants of the total
absence of lights in the streets.</p>
<p>Coaches had been engaged to take up the Tory witnesses for the
hearing of the election petition, while the Whigs were going to
London by the &ldquo;Ailsa Craig&rdquo; steam packet.</p>
<p>April 26th.&mdash;The following Committee had been struck for

<p>May 3rd.&mdash;This Committee had come to the
resolution&mdash;That C. E. Rumbold and W. Wilshere, Esqs., are
duly elected, but that the petition was not frivolous or
vexatious.</p>
<p>May 10th.&mdash;This decision appears to have been the result
of an arrangement made by a few gentlemen of the Whig and Tory
parties, that one of the members (it is believed Mr. Wilshere)
would accept the Chiltern Hundreds at the end of the present
Session of Parliament.&nbsp; It was believed in that event Mr.
Baring would be opposed.&nbsp; It is stated that &ldquo;of late
our members have not reposed on a bed of roses.&rdquo;</p>

by the contributions of each Alderman of &pound;10 and each
Common Councilman &pound;5 on his election.</p>
<p>May 31st.&mdash;The &ldquo;Pantaloon,&rdquo; a fine, large,
round-sterned brig of 180 tons, had been launched by her owners,
Messrs. A. and G. Steward; and the &ldquo;Victoria,&rdquo; 350
tons, by Mr. J. Preston.</p>
<p>A meeting had been held at the Town Hall to consider the
propriety of establishing a small Hospital for Great Yarmouth and
the East and West Fleggs and Mutford and Lothingland
Hundreds.&nbsp; The Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew presided, and amongst
those present were all the resident clergy and medical gentlemen
of the town, with Messrs. G. D. Palmer, Brightwen, W. Steward, B.
Dowson, Worship, &amp;c.</p>
<p>June 7th and 14th.&mdash;Col. Thompson had been suggested as a
candidate for the Borough, and Mr. Northhouse had addressed a
meeting on his behalf.&nbsp; Mr. George Steward was taking an
active part in this affair.</p>
<p>June 21st.&mdash;Suggestions were being made for the
celebration of the Queen&rsquo;s Coronation.</p>
<p>Messrs. Henry Emms and William Simms had been appointed
Relieving Officers.</p>
<p>The donations for the proposed Hospital were &pound;200 and
the annual subscriptions &pound;280.</p>
<p>June 28th.&mdash;This issue contains the following account of
how, after a futile effort had been made by the Vicar, which
appears not to have been a success, H.M. Coronation was
celebrated.&nbsp; At an &ldquo;adjourned meeting of the
subscribers to the fund for celebrating her Majesty&rsquo;s
Coronation, by giving a dinner to the poor children of the town
on that day, held at the New Hall, on Thursday evening last, the
Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew in the chair, those gentlemen who had
undertaken to collect subscriptions reported that they had
scarcely any further funds to add to those already
collected.&nbsp; Under these circumstances the chairman submitted
to the meeting that the proposed plan of feasting the children
was a failure from the want of funds.&nbsp; Considerable
discussion then ensued as to the propriety of taking steps
towards celebrating the Coronation day in any other way, upon
which there were many conflicting opinions.&nbsp; At length Mr.
Samuel Palmer, after recapitulating all that had been done, and
regretting that up to that time nothing had been realized,
moved&mdash;&lsquo;That a subscription be now entered into, to
provide such amusements for the poor of the town on the day of
the Coronation as may seem fit to the subscribers, and that a
committee be appointed to <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>carry the same into
effect.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Samuel Barber moved, as an amendment,
&lsquo;that all the poor of the town be regaled with roast beef
and plum pudding&rsquo;; but it appearing to the meeting that as
money enough could not be raised to regale the children, it would
be impossible to raise a sufficient sum to feast all the
poor.&nbsp; The amendment was negatived, and Mr. Palmer&rsquo;s
motion was unanimously carried.&nbsp; The Chairman then left the
chair, and Mr. George Danby Palmer was called on to preside, when
thanks were voted to the late Chairman; a spirited subscription
was begun in the room; a committee was appointed to carry Mr.
Palmer&rsquo;s motion into effect, and the meeting
separated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since that time the gentlemen composing the committee
have collected money to the amount of about &pound;200, and a
bill of fare has been issued sports and entertainments to take
place on the South Denes, amongst which are horse, pony, and
donkey races, jumping in sacks, climbing matches, and running
after pigs with soaped tails.&nbsp; There will also be sailing
matches on the river.&nbsp; A dinner will take place in a marquee
erected on the ground, the Mayor in the chair.&nbsp; A stand and
several booths have also been built for the accommodation of the
public.&nbsp; The amusements will conclude with a superb display
of fireworks, under the direction of an artist from
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>July 7th contains the following record of the result of such
action:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The festivities and sports which were to have
taken place on Thursday last in honour of the Coronation were
interrupted by a heavy fall of rain, which commenced at the hour
fixed for the fun to begin, and continued nearly,
&lsquo;sans&rsquo; intermission, until night.&nbsp; This untoward
state of the elements prevented any very great assembly of
multitude taking place; nevertheless there were some two or three
thousand determined holiday-makers congregated on the South
Denes, and the horse and pony races came off in spite of the
unfavourable state of the weather.&nbsp; The race for hacks was
well contested and won by Highflyer, beating Whiscumsnivet, the
Ambassador, and Sir William.&nbsp; The pony race was also a good
one; we could not learn the name of the winner.&nbsp; Four boats
started for the silver cup&mdash;value &pound;7&mdash;viz., the
Coriander (Balls), Leviathian (Preston), Louisa (Fiddis), and
Neptune (Green).&nbsp; The wind was light at starting, and
towards the end of the match there was so little as scarcely to
fill the sails; the Coriander won by about half a length.&nbsp;
The remainder of the sports were postponed until Friday
afternoon.&nbsp; At four o&rsquo;clock upwards of 100 gentlemen
sat down to dinner in a marquee erected <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>on the Denes,
the Mayor (Dr. Penrice) in the chair.&nbsp; After dinner the
health of the Queen was drunk with long, loud, and hearty cheers,
and the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were given; several
excellent songs were sung, and about half-past ten the company
returned to the town preceded by a band of music.&nbsp; The
children at the various charity schools and the inmates of the
Fishermen&rsquo;s Hospital were handsomely entertained.&nbsp; The
Temperance people had a tea meeting, and all, as far as the
weather would permit, appeared to enjoy themselves in their own
way.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, at three o&rsquo;clock, the sports were
re-commenced, the weather being most propitious and the sun
shining with surpassing brilliancy.&nbsp; Yarmouth poured out
thousands upon thousands of its working population, and great
numbers of all classes were present to witness the fun and
partake of the amusement of the day.&nbsp; The performances, if
so they may be called, took place on a stage immediately opposite
the stand, which was filled with spectators, under the
superintendence and direction of a gentleman, to whose good
humoured exertions too much praise cannot be given, and who was
ably assisted by others in providing and bringing out such
entertainments for the humbler classes as seemed best adapted to
their taste and habits.&nbsp; First came two chimney sweeps in
<i>full costume</i>; they dived in a tub of meal for pieces of
money, which they picked out with their mouths.&nbsp; Numberless
sneezings and many collisions of sooty heads, now, however,
converted into floury nobs, took place during this match, to the
great merriment of the assembled crowds; at length the money was
all abstracted, and the performers, well washed, made their bows
and retired from the stage.&nbsp; Next came bobbing for oranges
in tubs of water, by boys with their hands tied behind
them.&nbsp; Then a singing match by boys, which was won by an
urchin of the name of John Hutchin, who sung two comic songs with
inimitable humour and effect.&nbsp; A horn pipe match followed,
in which the best dancers made up by agility for what was wanting
in grace and elegance.&nbsp; Grinning through horse collars
succeeded, and here one Billy Derry out-uglied the
ugliest&mdash;O! for grinning through a horse collar, commend me
to Billy Derry.&nbsp; Then we had six old women, drinking
scalding hot tea for a prize of one sovereign; the efforts of
these poor old creatures to gulp down the almost boiling fluid,
were at once both pitiable and ludicrous, but they appeared to
enjoy the parts they were acting almost as much as the spectators
did, who gave way to the most uproarious laughter we ever
remember to have heard, they were all well rewarded for their
exhibition.&nbsp; <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>There were also donkey races, climbing soaped poles,
gingling matches, running wheelbarrows blindfold, a rowing match,
and races after pigs with their tails soaped, and twenty-four
barrels of ale were given away to the populace on the
ground.&nbsp; At half-past ten at night the Market Place was
literally crammed with people to witness the display of
fireworks, which was splendid and worthy of the occasion, and
concluded the Coronation amusements.&nbsp; Immediately after the
fireworks had ceased the crowd dispersed, and by twelve
o&rsquo;clock the streets were as quiet as upon ordinary
occasions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>July 14th.&mdash;The Corporation had voted an address to the
Queen, of which the following is the notice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At an assembly of the Corporation, held on
Wednesday, the Mayor read a congratulatory address to Her Majesty
the Queen, upon the Coronation, which was unanimously adopted by
the Council, and Mr. Barth, Mr. Robert Palmer Kemp and Mr. Samuel
Palmer, were appointed a deputation to carry up and present the
same; it being left to the option of any other gentlemen of the
Council to join the deputation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mayor, preceded by the Regalia, had walked to church,
&ldquo;unaccompanied by a single member of the Town
Council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>July 5th.&mdash;Col. Thompson had declined to come
forward.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Symonds had given a silver cup, value &pound;5 5s., to
be bowled for in honour of the Coronation.&nbsp; There were 34
competitors, and it was won by Mr. John Porrett, &ldquo;the
veteran bowler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>July 12th.&mdash;A meeting of freemen to oppose Mr.
Baring&rsquo;s return at the ensuing election had been held at
the Masonic Hall, Mr. Joseph Bayly (Chairman).&nbsp; Capt. Love,
Mr. John Clowes, jun., Mr. Lawrence, and Mr. Charles Marsh took
part in the proceedings, and the following gentlemen were
appointed a committee to carry the resolutions passed at the
meeting into effect:&mdash;Messrs. Joseph Bayly, John Clowes,
jun., S. Cobb, E. R. Palmer, Henry Pickard, Charles Marsh, Thomas
Thompson, jun., and Capt. Love.</p>
<p>The Corporation address to Her Majesty had been presented by
Messrs. Barth, R. P. Kemp, and S. Palmer.</p>
<p>July 26th.&mdash;The Water Frolic had been held, when the

barge.</p>
<p>Dr. Penrice (the Mayor) and Dr. Cox has been elected

<p>August 16th.&mdash;The freemen had determined to re-elect Mr.

speaking on the subject; and a committee had been formed to
further this object, of which Mr. Cobb was chairman, Mr. J.
Bayly, secretary, and Mr. J. Clowes, treasurer.</p>
<p>August 16th.&mdash;The new Writ had been moved for, and the

follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Friday the first half-yearly meeting of
the governors and subscribers to the Hospital was held at the
Town Hall, the Hon. and Rev. Edward Pellew in the chair.&nbsp;
Mr. A. Drew was unanimously elected resident Dispenser, at a
salary of &pound;60 per annum.&nbsp; Some alterations of the
rules were agreed upon.&nbsp; Mr. S. S. Barber then moved that
the votes for officers to the institution should be taken by
ballot, and not by voting papers, as at the first meeting, which
was lost by a majority of 17 to 13.&nbsp; It is intended to bring
the question forward again at the next meeting.&nbsp; The Rev. J.
North, honorary secretary to the institution, stated that at the
last yearly meeting of the old Dispensary, in October, it was
resolved that an application be made to the subscribers to the
Hospital for a grant from their funds to discharge the additional
bills.&nbsp; At Lady-day last they had moved into the house at
present used for the Hospital.&nbsp; They soon felt they could
not maintain the increased expenditure with the same funds, and a
meeting was called of the subscribers, when the proposition was
first started for the Hospital, and in the end the Hospital was
established.&nbsp; At the close of the year, owing to
circumstances over which he could not say who had the control, it
was found that the managers of the Dispensary could not pay their
liabilities by &pound;33.&nbsp; They had furniture which was
valued at &pound;7 10s., leaving them minus &pound;25 10s.
0&frac14;d.&nbsp; He now asked whether they would make a grant of
that amount from the funds of the Hospital.&nbsp; B. Dowson,
Esq., proposed that a transfer be made of that sum to defray the
deficiency, the new institution having been established on the
old one.&nbsp; C. Nichols, Esq., seconded it on the further
ground that the old institution had deferred several applications
for assistance for the benefit of the Hospital, such as sermons
at church, &amp;c.&nbsp; Mr. North said all their funds had been
merged into those of the Hospital.&nbsp; John Lacon, Esq.,
thought it would be <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>better to raise the sum among themselves, which
proposition, after a great deal of discussion, was ultimately
carried, and 13 sovereigns were subscribed in the room.&nbsp; The
decision was extremely satisfactory to all the new subscribers to
the Hospital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>July 4th contains the following as to the Yarmouth Hospital
and Dispensary:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The first annual meeting of this Institution was
held at the Town Hall on Friday last, on which occasion the
Worshipful the Mayor was in the chair.&nbsp; He felt gratified by
the honour that meeting had done him in calling him to the
chair.&nbsp; In looking over the programme of the meeting, he
found the accounts were to be audited&mdash;they were requested
to pay their subscriptions, to elect annual officers, and to take
into consideration the erection or purchase of a building for a
new Hospital.</p>
<p>William Steward, Esq., read abstracts from the secretary and
treasurer&rsquo;s books, by which it appeared that the
benefactions amounted to &pound;292 9s. 6d., subscriptions to
&pound;435 19s., and interest at the bankers &pound;8 15s. 2d.,
and that there had been expended for fitting up and furniture,
&pound;141 8s. 10d.; for housekeeping, salaries, and wages,
&pound;94 15s. 9d.; chemists&rsquo; bills, drugs, &amp;c.,
&pound;90 15s.; books, stationery, and printing, &pound;35 14s.
9d.; rent and incidentals, &pound;33 3s. 1d.; leaving a balance
in treasurer&rsquo;s hands of &pound;341 6s. 3d.&nbsp; Mr.
Steward stated that the accounts had been made out with great
care, and examined by two auditors.&nbsp; The total number of
patients that had been admitted from October 1st, 1838, to June
1st, 1839, was 532, being 35 in and 439 out-patients, of whom 5
in and 9 out remained on the books.</p>
<p>J. Tidswell, Esq., moved that the report now read be received,
that it be ordered to be printed, and a copy placed in the hands
of each of the subscribers, which was seconded by the Rev. W. F.
Clarke, and carried unanimously.</p>
<p>The meeting then proceeded to the election of such officers as
retire annually, when all the old officers were unanimously
elected, with one alteration.&nbsp; The Rev. M. Waters, who had
been on the Committee, having accepted the office of honorary
secretary, <i>vice</i> Rev. J. North, who had left the town, J.
Tidswell, Esq., was chosen in his room.</p>
<p>The Chairman said the next business was of considerable
importance.&nbsp; It was to consider the propriety of erecting or
purchasing a building for the use of the Institution.</p>
<p>William Steward, Esq., would submit to the meeting a proposal
he held in his hand, which was to raise a building fund of
&pound;1,000, in shares of &pound;10 each, on which interest at
&pound;3 per cent. per annum is to be paid till the fund will
enable them to liquidate it; and in the interim every <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>shareholder
to have the right of recommending one out-patient for each share
annually.&nbsp; One object in raising the fund now was, that they
had &pound;151 in hand from the benefactions, and Mr. Anguish had
sent them &pound;50 towards the building fund.&nbsp; The interest
would not amount to what they now paid for rent.&nbsp; They hoped
the Corporation would grant them an eligible site for the
intended new building.</p>
<p>The Rev. M. Waters was sure there would be no difficulty in
raising the required fund, as they would soon have &pound;300
paid in donations, which would prevent any risk to the
shareholders.</p>
<p>The Chairman suggested that it would be better first to
resolve that it would be expedient to erect or purchase a
building, and then to submit the means for raising the money, in
which opinion J. Brightwen, Esq., fully concurred, when</p>
<p>Mr. S. S. Barber proposed, that it is the opinion of this
meeting that it is expedient that an Hospital should be built,
which was seconded by Mr. E. H. L. Preston.</p>
<p>Mr. W. S. Lacon thought it premature to build at present; the
Hospital had only been in operation a few months, and at the last
meeting, when certain resolutions were proposed, certain
gentlemen, who did not like those resolutions, said they would
withdraw.&nbsp; He would propose that the consideration of the
question be postponed to that day twelve months, which was
seconded by Dr. Sabine.</p>
<p>J. G. Fisher, Esq., thought the building of an Hospital would
promote the object they had in view, and could not agree with Mr.
Lacon, in which he was supported by the Rev. M. Waters.</p>
<p>The amendment being put, only six voted for it, and the
original motion was carried.</p>
<p>Mr. E H. L. Preston then proposed that the plan for raising a
fund, as proposed by Mr. Steward, be adopted, and that a paper be
laid on the table to receive the names of persons willing to take
shares, which was seconded by Mr. Barber.</p>
<p>J. G. Fisher, Esq., proposed the thanks of the meeting to the
Mayor for his conduct in the chair, which was carried by
acclamation.</p>
<p>The Mayor, in returning thanks, expressed his determination to
do all in his power to procure them an eligible spot on which to
erect the new edifice.&nbsp; Those present having paid their
subscriptions, the meeting separated.</p>

Hospital&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The half-yearly meeting of the governors of this
institution was held at the Town Hall on Saturday.&nbsp; William
Steward, Esq., took the chair, and stated that the building was
expected to be completed for the reception of patients by
Lady-day.&nbsp; The cost of the building, including furniture and
the tower (a very ornamental building, to be used as a look-out),
with other incidental charges, would amount to
&pound;1,600.&nbsp; (Expressions <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>of surprise, and &ldquo;What! no
more?&rdquo;)&nbsp; He believed that &pound;1,600 would cover the
whole expense, to meet which they had already received by
benefaction (including &pound;200 from the Norwich Musical
Festival) upwards of &pound;600, while upwards of &pound;1,000
had been raised among the shareholders.&nbsp; It would be highly
desirable to pay off the shareholders as the funds would allow,
and to keep up the annual subscriptions.&nbsp; At present they
were adequate to the annual expenditure, but he trusted the
inhabitants would do their utmost to increase the annual
income.&nbsp; This was the only charitable institution founded on
the day of her Majesty&rsquo;s Coronation, and he was induced to
hope that an application to Her Majesty&rsquo;s advisers would
obtain a benefaction from her privy purse.&nbsp; He was sanguine
in his anticipation that in a short time the shares would be
reduced to one for each shareholder, which it was thought
desirable should remain.</p>
<p>F. R. Reynolds, Esq., thought the reduction would be made in
less than seven years.</p>
<p>The Rev. M. Waters said that, allowing them to remain in their
present position, the new institution would not be more rent than
the present Hospital in Queen Street.</p>
<p>Mr. Steward then submitted a resolution, that all monies
arising from benefactions or otherwise, except from annual
subscriptions, be applied in paying the shareholders till such
shareholders should have but one share each; and that the annual
subscriptions should be kept as a distinct fund.</p>
<p>This resolution was moved by H. V. Worship, Esq., and seconded
by C. J. Palmer, Esq., and carried unanimously.</p>
<p>The Secretary observed that the balance of subscriptions would
be less at the end of the present year than it was at the end of
the preceding one, and this he mentioned that the public might
know it would depend on themselves whether so excellent an
institution should continue as efficient as it had hitherto
been.</p>
<p>It was stated that the number of out-patients had never been
less than 100 throughout the past half-year.</p>

class="GutSmall">THE FUNERAL OF CAPTAIN HARMER, R.N.</span></p>
<p>The following particulars, relative to the interment of this
much lamented officer (who died while in command of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s steam frigate &ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; in China),
will, (the Editor thinks), no doubt, be read with much
interest:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">H.M.S. &ldquo;Thalia,&rdquo; at
Chusan, China,<br />
17th April, 1843.</p>
<p>As I have arranged, with the kind concurrence of Major General
Sir James Schoedde, that the interment of the late lamented Capt.
Harmer, of Her Majesty&rsquo;s steam frigate
&ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; shall take place to-morrow forenoon at ten
o&rsquo;clock; it is my direction that the officers, seamen, and
marines mentioned underneath, be sent in boats also stated
against each ship&rsquo;s name, so as to assemble round the
&ldquo;Driver&rdquo; at half-past nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The
procession of boats will leave the &ldquo;Driver&rdquo; precisely
at ten o&rsquo;clock and proceed to the West pier, abreast that
vessel, when it will be met by the Major General and all the
officers of the garrison and a detachment of 100 rank and file of
Her Majesty&rsquo;s 95th Regiment, as that gallant officer has,
in the most handsome and kind manner, expressed an anxious wish
to pay every possible mark of respect to the remains of the much
regretted Capt. Harmer.&nbsp; As many of the officers of the army
lost their full dress coats during the late war in this country,
I have arranged with General Sir James Schoedde, in order that
both services may appear alike, that all the officers of the navy
and marines appear in undress coats, epaulettes, cocked hats and
swords, with crape on the left arm above the elbow, if it can be
procured in time.&nbsp; The marines will be in full dress, but
without chakos, and will be provided with three rounds of blank
cartridges for every man.&nbsp; The seamen are to be in blue
jackets and trousers, white frocks and black hats.&nbsp; All the
arrangements on the part of the army are to be conducted by Major
O&rsquo;Leary, Brigade Major of Chusan; on the part of the navy,
Capt. Quin, of H.M.S. &ldquo;Minden.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pall bearers are to be three Field Officers of the army,
and the Commanders of the &ldquo;Pelican,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Serpent,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pylades.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lieut.
Kisbee, of the &ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; will be chief mourner,
supported by the Officers of that vessel.</p>
<p>H.M.S. &ldquo;Thalia.&rdquo;&mdash;Four boats, three
lieutenants, purser, naval <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>instructor, two medical officers, one
midshipman, three volunteers (1st class.)</p>
<p>H.M.S. &ldquo;Minden.&rdquo;&mdash;Three boats, two
lieutenants, master, purser, two medical officers, two volunteers
(1st class), one sergeant and ten marines.</p>
<p>H.M.S. &ldquo;Pelican&rdquo;&mdash;Two boats, two lieutenants,
one medical officer, purser, one mate, one midshipman one
volunteer (1st class), one sergeant, and fifteen marines.</p>
<p>H.M.S. &ldquo;Serpent&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Pylades.&rdquo;&mdash;Same as &ldquo;Pelican&rdquo; in
every respect as to boats and marines, and as nearly as possible
with regard to officers.</p>
<p>All the officers and crew of the &ldquo;Driver&rdquo; will
attend, excepting those left on board to take care of the
vessel.&nbsp; The above number of boats is exclusive of those the
Captains and Commanders will be in.</p>
<p>The colours of all the squadron will be hoisted half-mast high
at eight o&rsquo;clock, and remain so till sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Signed,<br />
<span class="smcap">Chas. Hope</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Captain of H.M.S.
&ldquo;Thalia,&rdquo; and senior officer Chusan.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;The boats will be provided with ensigns and
pendants, but only the former will be half-mast high.</p>
<p>Capt. Harmer was buried under the fort, surrounded by hundreds
of his brethren in arms, who were either killed at the last
capture of Chusan or who died from the effects of the
climate.&nbsp; The officers of the &ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; much to
their credit, and evincing a proper respect for a much-loved
commander, have erected a neat monument over his remains at their
own expense.&nbsp; So highly was he esteemed, even by the
Chinese, that numbers of the respectable men of the city also
attended.</p>
<p>The merchant ships, following the example of the squadron,
kept their colours half-mast high until sunset.</p>
<p>Of Capt. Harmer it might well be said, in the language of the
order, &ldquo;that he paid proper respect to those who were
destined to rule over him; that he worked diligently, lived
creditably, and acted honourably by all men.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Brother, farewell.</p>

took place on the 10th of June.&nbsp; On the 12th of June, Mr.
Marsh was going along King-street, when defendant came up to him,
seized him by the arm, and making use of some very offensive
expressions, demanded an explanation for the impertinent manner
in which the Mayor had treated his letter.&nbsp; The Mayor
replied that he was the Chief Magistrate of the <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>town, that
his hands were therefore tied up, and that he could not enter
into any explanation then.&nbsp; Mr. Aldred then reiterated the
expressions, and followed Mr. Marsh up the street, still
repeating them all the time.&nbsp; Mr. Marsh after this sent two
persons to Mr. Aldred, requesting him to consider what he had
done, and whether he would not attend to make some apology for
his conduct.&nbsp; Mr. Aldred did attend, but instead of making
an apology he repeated the observations again in a manner most
offensive to the Mayor.&nbsp; After the first offence, the Mayor
thought to take proceedings against the defendant for sureties to
keep the peace, but considered that the repetition of such
conduct in an open Court was such an aggravation of the original
offence, that he felt it due to his office and himself to take
other proceedings.&nbsp; One of the Magistrates insisted on
taking sureties, which he did two or three days afterwards.&nbsp;
But he (Mr. Martin) apprehended that the circumstances of this
case were such as not to deprive Mr. Marsh on that account of
coming to this Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Patteson&mdash;You do not put this as being a
provocation to a breach of the peace?</p>
<p>Mr. Martin&mdash;It was an actual breach of the peace, for an
assault was committed.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Patteson&mdash;That was in the first
instance.&nbsp; There was nothing but words in the second
instance, but the Magistrate was acting at the time in his
magisterial capacity.</p>
<p>Mr. Martin&mdash;It was so; and they thought it also right to
have an affidavit from the Police-constable, who stated in his
affidavit that he merely delivered the paper without any
offensive expression whatever, and the answer he received was
&ldquo;D---n the Mayor and Magistrates; what do I care for
them?&mdash;Rule <i>nisi</i> granted.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">The Queen on the prosecution of
Samuel Charles Marsh, Esq., v. Charles Cory Aldred.</p>
<p>Mr. Martin&mdash;My Lord, in the case of the Queen v. Aldred,
my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, will address your Lordship.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson&mdash;In this case, my Lord, Mr. Aldred has been
indicted for having spoken certain words of the prosecutor; he
has pleaded not guilty.&nbsp; This gentleman, I have to state,
used the words under some mistake, and he is now anxious to
withdraw his plea of not guilty, and to express his regret for
having used the words of which the prosecutor has
complained.&nbsp; I have now, therefore, to withdraw the plea of
not guilty and to enter a plea of guilty.</p>
<p>Mr. Martin&mdash;My Lord, I appear on behalf of the
prosecutor, the Mayor of Yarmouth, who felt himself compelled to
bring the matter before the Court.&nbsp; He has no personal
feeling in the matter, and is perfectly satisfied with the
expression of regret made by my learned friend, and upon payment
of the costs by the defendant, if your Lordship pleases, he will
not proceed further.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Coleridge&mdash;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yarham (who figured in the Chandler murder case) had &ldquo;at
length <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

quit the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 3rd.&mdash;Only one tender had been sent in for the New
Haven Bridge, and it was considered probable that the plans for
it would be amended.</p>
<p>May 10th.&mdash;Reports the &ldquo;Fall of the Yarmouth
Suspension Bridge,&rdquo; (with a wood-cut of the wreck of that
structure), which had happened on Friday, the 2nd inst.&nbsp; The
following is extracted from such report:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>On the afternoon of the day on which this
narration bears date, Nelson, the Clown at Mr. Cooke&rsquo;s
Circus, had undertaken to swim in a tub, drawn by four geese,
from the drawbridge on the Quay to the Suspension Bridge across
the North river&mdash;a foolish exhibition&mdash;but it was one
which, from its novelty in Yarmouth, was calculated to attract
the multitude.&nbsp; As early as five o&rsquo;clock, when the
train arrived from Norwich, although raining smartly, thousands
of spectators had already assembled to witness the feat on both
sides of the river.&nbsp; The Bridge was then comparatively
clear.&nbsp; The Clown commenced his feat with the flood tide at
the drawbridge, and had entered the North river.&nbsp; There were
many persons on the Bridge, and as he drew near, the multitude
upon it endeavoured to obtain a full view as he should pass
underneath.&nbsp; Already had he reached Bessey&rsquo;s Wharf,
not far from the Bridge, when one or two of the rods were
observed to give way; an instant alarm was given to quit the
bridge.&nbsp; Alas! the caution came too late.&nbsp; The chains
broke, and quick as the passing thought, one entire side fell,
and the whole mass of the human beings, whose numbers were
estimated from three to four hundred, were swept into the river
below.&nbsp; The traffic road of the Bridge, which but an instant
before was horizontal, had become nearly perpendicular.</p>
<p>The children, poor little things, of whom there were very
many, and had naturally gathered to the balustrade, were of
course the first to sink, while the force with which the whole
fell, caused those who were in the background to be hurled with
terrific force into the water beneath, crushing and annihilating
those under them.</p>
<p>Oh! who shall paint the one mighty simultaneous agonizing
death-scream which burst upon the affrighted multitude
around&mdash;re-echoing from earth to heaven&mdash;may the appeal
not be made in vain.&nbsp; One instant and all was hushed, save
the struggling of a few whose lives it pleased their Maker in his
mercy to spare.&nbsp; The waters, we are told, as if gifted with
a sudden impulse of horror, at this fell swoop of death, recoiled
in the impetus of the fall and &ldquo;boiled up&rdquo; at the
back of the <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Bridge, which hung perpendicularly below the surface of
the river.&nbsp; As suddenly the struggle for life was past to
all but a few.</p>
<p>Then came a scene scarcely less heartrending.&nbsp; With an
energy, activity, and stern determination of purpose, which are
among the wise and merciful provisions of the Almighty,
twenty-seven children, all girls, were immediately rescued alive
on the West side of the river, and as instantly put to bed at the
&ldquo;Vauxhall Gardens,&rdquo; who as soon as revived were
replaced by others equally beneficially spared, or by some never
to be recalled.&nbsp; Some scrambled out and rushed home to their
own houses, not a few fainting after arriving safe at home.&nbsp;
On the East side numbers of bodies were taken into the adjoining
houses, where all the assistance which medical skill, humane
attention, in short all the aid which humanity would teach
everyone to offer, was brought to bear.&nbsp; Alas how often in
vain.&nbsp; In one house alone, at nine o&rsquo;clock at night,
out of sixty-eight bodies carried in only three were revived.</p>
<p>Many a touching scene was witnessed as the anxious mother, and
the hardly less excited father or friend, recognised some missing
one safely emerging from the crowd.&nbsp; Thousands thronged the
North Quay&mdash;messengers were despatched in all directions to
procure medical aid, and the communication with the West side of
the water being cut off, hundreds were left in painful suspense
respecting those who were safe on the opposite shore.&nbsp;
Nothing could exceed the promptitude, activity, and attention of
the surgeons and medical men of the town, all of whom were in
immediate attendance doing all they could to afford relief to the
sufferers, where the slightest chance of resuscitation
appeared.&nbsp; Mr. Lacon and a number of the persons employed in
his brewery were exceedingly active in supplying hot water for
baths, which is not far distant.&nbsp; All the blankets from the
Union House that could possibly be spared were in
requisition.</p>
<p>The scene now presented is still most agonising.&nbsp;
Children, mothers, and fathers, seeking one or other of their
families, tracing and discovering in the pale face of some of the
dead, one of their dearest ties.&nbsp; In every street are to be
seen one or more bodies extended on biers, returning to that home
from which but short minutes before they had passed in health and
life.&nbsp; The consternation&mdash;the agony of the town is not
to be described&mdash;it is as if some dread punishment was felt
to have fallen upon its inhabitants&mdash;every face is
horror-stricken&mdash;every eye is dim.</p>
<p>Never since the devastating plague in 1664, which swept off
2000 of its inhabitants, has Yarmouth, notwithstanding its
numberless shipwrecks, <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>been visited with so dire a
calamity, occurring too at the very moment a public meeting was
about to be held to make arrangements for the distribution of the
funds which have been received for the widows and families of the
Beachmen who were lost in January last.&nbsp; How many are there
added to this list?&nbsp; We dare not anticipate&mdash;Time will
show.</p>
<p>Numbers, it is believed, are entangled with the rods and other
portions of the broken Bridge.&nbsp; At this hour it is
impossible to say how many or who are called to their dread
accounts.&nbsp; The escape of some was miraculous.&nbsp; One
woman, of the name of Gillings, the wife of a carpenter, was on
the Bridge with her child; when she was hurled into the water,
with extraordinary presence of mind she seized her child&rsquo;s
clothes with her teeth&mdash;thus preventing the rush of water,
and paddled herself to a place of safety.</p>
<p>On the East side of the Bridge the greater number were taken
to the &ldquo;Norwich Arms Inn,&rdquo; where there were at one
time fifty-three corpses.&nbsp; Others were taken to the
&ldquo;Admiral Collingwood&rdquo; and to the &ldquo;Swan,&rdquo;
and many to their own houses.&nbsp; Not a few of those who first
got out of the water went away unnoticed, and their number is
unknown.&nbsp; Up to a late hour last night, it was ascertained
that seventy-five dead bodies had been taken out of the water;
and up to midnight, from the enquiries made, it was ascertained
that forty-five others were missing.</p>
<p>By far the greater number of those lost were females and
children.&nbsp; James Marshall, 16, escaped with a wound in the
scalp.&nbsp; Two boys named Honorley, aged twelve and seventeen,
were taken home, the younger died last evening, the elder is
likely to recover.</p>
<p>The inquest on the bodies of the drowned was held next day at
the &ldquo;Church Hall,&rdquo; before W. S. Ferrier, Esq.,
coroner, when the following gentlemen were sworn on the
Jury:&mdash;Samuel Palmer, Esq., (foreman), and Messrs. John
Norman, John Orfeur, John Fenn, G. B. Palmer, William Smith,
William Spillings, Charles Barber, Charles Woolverton, Joseph
Davy, James Emms, William Haylett, Mark Blowers, J. E. Laws, John
Stagg, E. Garrod, Thomas Davy, and James Pratt, and after hearing
evidence as to the identification of the bodies of the drowned
was adjourned <i>sine die</i>.&nbsp; The following list of the
victims is given:&mdash;</p>

<p>Leaving a balance of about &pound;600 in hand, and it was

hearing evidence, arrived at the following verdict in one case
which governed the rest:&mdash;&ldquo;That deceased came to her
death by the falling of the Suspension Bridge across the river
Bure, in this Borough, on the 2nd May, 1845; and that the falling
of the bridge was attributable immediately to a defect in the
joint or welding of the bar that first gave way, and to the
quality of part of the iron, the workmanship being inferior to
the requirements of the original contract, which had provided
that such should be of the first quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 31st.&mdash;A temporary bridge had been opened across the
Bure.</p>
<p>The Committee on the Norfolk and Suffolk Railway lines had
met.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Diss, Beccles and Yarmouth&rdquo; promoters

Lowestoft with Yarmouth, and had agreed to go to Reedham and
abandon Yarmouth.&nbsp; The Lowestoft line had passed through
committee.</p>
<p>The Yarmouth and Norwich line was thrown out as regarded the

being converted into a Naval Lunatic Asylum.</p>
<p>June 14th.&mdash;Three of the houses on Brandon Terrace were

<p>An arrangement had been come to between the Directors of the
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Norwich

and the Company were to erect a free bridge over the river, but
it was still doubtful on which side of the stream the station
would be erected.</p>
<p>June 21st.&mdash;The price agreed to be paid by the Company
for this right, with the adjacent land required by them and
Paget&rsquo;s brewery was stated by the <i>Bury Post</i> to be

Wilshere) had attended an Anti-Corn Law League meeting at the
Corn Hall.</p>

reporter appears to have considered of more importance than the
sailing matches, as regards which he makes the faintest
allusion.</p>
<p>Aug. 12th.&mdash;The Regatta had been a great success, 5,000
persons coming from Norwich alone.&nbsp; The following yachts
competed:&mdash;&ldquo;Belvidere&rdquo; (Lord A. Paget),

Vauxhall Gardens, among whom were the members for the
Borough.</p>
<p>Aug. 9th.&mdash;A hurricane had visited the town, but beyond
dismasting two vessels and blowing a girl into a pool of water
does not appear to have caused much mischief.</p>
<p>The only mails then brought to Yarmouth by rail were those
from London and Norwich.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Repository&rdquo; sale at the Bath Room on the

was identified by W. H. Palmer, Esq., who stated that he left her
the previous night at the door of the Theatre about ten minutes
before eleven; her sister, Miss E. Sayers, went home in a sedan
chair and deceased walked.&nbsp; The night was extremely dark and
rainy, but no gas lamps were lighted.&nbsp; Captain Pearson and
his family were spending the evening out, and on returning at
about half-past eleven, found Miss E. Sayers in some anxiety that
her sister was so long in following her.&nbsp; Captain Pearson
immediately went to the police office to procure assistance in
searching for her, for which purpose Police-constable Page took a
lantern.&nbsp; About half-past three in the morning he dragged
the river opposite the Town Hall, and there found the body.&nbsp;
The watch of deceased stopped precisely at eleven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The Jury returned a verdict that the
deceased was accidentally drowned by walking over the Quay-head,
in consequence of the extreme darkness of the night.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>1851.</h3>
<p>Jan. 4th.&mdash;At the meeting of the Town Council, the
Councillors for the St. George&rsquo;s, Market and Gorleston
Wards refused to appoint Ward Aldermen &ldquo;as they had no
confidence&rdquo; in the Aldermen recently appointed by the
casting vote of the Mayor.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Water question&rdquo; was before the public, when,
as to the Ormesby water with which it was proposed to supply the
town, Mr. Cooper, an eminent analytical chemist, stated that such
water &ldquo;was turbid from the green and brown matter in
it&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the large quantity (four grains) of
vegetable organic matter that it contained rendered it wholly
unfit for domestic purposes other than cleansing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan. 11th.&mdash;Chas. J. Palmer had presided at the Annual
Public Library meeting, when it was stated that upwards of 5,000
books belonged to that institution.</p>
<p>J. Tolver, Esq. had sent in his resignation as Clerk to the
Paving Commissioners.</p>
<p>Jan. 25th.&mdash;It was stated that a provisional order was
about to be issued, applying the &ldquo;Health of Town&rsquo;s
Act&rdquo; to the Borough, thus threatening the Paving
Commissioners with extinction.</p>
<p>There was great complaint against these Commissioners for not
properly lighting the Denes.</p>
<p>Wm. Sumner, an ex-constable was bound over to keep the peace
at the instance of Samuel Tolver, Esq.</p>
<p>Feb. 1st.&mdash;The following notice appears as to No. 4,
South Quay:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A tradition has long existed in connection with
the Elizabethian House upon the Quay, formerly belonging to John
Carter, the regicide, <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>but now the residence of C. J.
Palmer, Esq., F.S.A., (mentioned by Noble, vol. 2, p. 340), that
of the &ldquo;many secret consults&rdquo; which the rebels held
prior to the trial and execution of King Charles I. the fatal and
final one took place in a chamber in the above mentioned house,
in which Carter then lived.&nbsp; A meeting of the chief
Parliamentarian Generals was summoned, and the regicides, it is
said, met early in the afternoon, and the conference, which was
one of &lsquo;great secrecy,&rsquo; did not terminate until near
the hour of midnight, the dinner which had been ordered for four
o&rsquo;clock not being served until the meeting broke up.&nbsp;
This tradition, though generally credited, had hitherto received
no confirmation to render it of historical value.&nbsp; The
important fact has, however, been placed almost beyond a doubt,
as we can state on the authority of F. Worship, Esq., that in the
course of the labours of the Committee recently appointed by the
Town Council to inquire into the ancient records and muniments of
the Borough, a record has been found of the visit of Oliver
Cromwell to our town about the time alluded to, it having never
yet been definitely ascertained that the Protector visited
Yarmouth.&nbsp; We hope this very interesting discovery will
induce the Committee to prosecute their labours, and when the
valuable town documents have been arranged and restored, the
Council will see the propriety and necessity of providing some
suitable depository for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feb. 8th.&mdash;The New Mercantile Marine Act had excited much
dissatisfaction, and several handbills had appeared urging the
sailors to take action, and on Tuesday morning having
&ldquo;struck,&rdquo; they mustered in groups on the
Hall-quay.&nbsp; Subsequently they formed in procession to the
number of 1,000 and paraded the town for several hours; they had
a band and flags with them, and a board on which was written
&ldquo;Do not sign the laws&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wages &pound;2
15s.&nbsp; Summer and Winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Seaman&rsquo;s Union had been formed having 450 members, and
Mr. J. Teasdel having given notice that he did not intend to
reduce the wages paid to his men to 50s. a month, several hundred
of the men on strike, went over the Bridge and manned the yards
of a vessel belonging to that gentleman, for whom they gave some
loud and hearty cheers.</p>
<p>The Magistrates refused to sign a 1s. 9d.&nbsp; Poor rate, but
such rate was subsequently signed by Mr. W. H. Palmer and Mr. J.
Fenn and the rate for that amount made.</p>
<p>Feb. 15th.&mdash;A meeting of the shipowners had been held at
the Town-hall to consider the seamen&rsquo;s grievances, the
Mayor in the chair, when upon the motion of Mr. George
Danby-Palmer, a resolution was carried <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>to obtain a
repeal of the act of Parliament complained of, and a Committee
formed consisting of six owners and six seamen with the Mayor as
chairman to give effect to such resolution; the wages question
was, however, not discussed.</p>
<p>Feb. 22nd.&mdash;A further meeting had been held &ldquo;to
take into consideration the present complaint of seamen
respecting their wages, that the same may be equalized throughout
the year whether by voyage or month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About 30 owners were present, and also the Sailors&rsquo;
Committee; the Mayor was in the chair, and the sailors refused to
be bound by their &ldquo;old agreement;&rdquo; the following
account is given of their subsequent proceedings:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the above meeting a letter has been sent to
the Mayor, announcing that the sailors were determined not to
abide for the future by the old agreement; and handbills were
also publicly issued, announcing a &ldquo;grand procession&rdquo;
of the seamen of the port for the following day.&nbsp;
Accordingly on Saturday the sailors assembled opposite to their
rendezvous, at the Royal Exchange on the Quay, to the number of
about 1,500, and flags, union jacks, &amp;c., with a band of
music having been procured, a procession was formed, which
paraded the town for several hours.&nbsp; The men were mostly
respectably attired, and wore rosettes of various colours, from
which were suspended the medals of the Shipwrecked
Mariners&rsquo; Society.&nbsp; Some of the men were dressed in
various emblematical characters, such as Britannia, Neptune,
Amphitrite, Triton, &amp;c., and were borne upon the shoulders of
the crowd in boats, dolphin cars, &amp;c., which were decorated
with evergreens, &amp;c., in short the whole assemblage seemed
more like a triumphal procession than that of a demonstration
occasioned by one of those unfortunate breaches between employers
and employed, termed a &ldquo;strike.&rdquo;&nbsp; Throughout the
crowd a number of placards were distributed, bearing the
following inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;We, the seamen of Yarmouth,
hereby testify our gratitude to the inhabitants, for the handsome
manner in which they have come forward to assist us in obtaining
our just rights.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also a number of poles, terminating
in tridents, fishes, &amp;c., were borne aloft, together with a
handsomely carved model ship, covered with the flags of all
nations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. S. S. Barber had applied to the Bench for the assistance
of the civil force to protect his seamen, who had just arrived by
the &ldquo;Maid of the Yare,&rdquo; London Trader, and who had
been persuaded to leave their vessel, and even threatened to be
taken away by force if <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>they did not leave.&nbsp; The
Superintendent and some of the police went down to the spot, but,
as the men remained perfectly peaceable, their presence was not
at all required.</p>
<p>The following members of the Council had addressed a letter to
the Treasury protesting against a proposed loan for drainage
purposes, which was said to have been carried by a majority of
the Council at its last meeting:&mdash;Sir E. H. K. Lacon, R.
Ferrier, E. H. L. Preston, F. Worship, William H. Palmer, R.
Steward, R. D. Barber, E. R. Aldred, J. C. Smith, J. G. Plummer,
J. Cherry, J. E. Barnby, C. C. Aldred, B. Jay, R. Ferrier, junr.,
S. Miller and William Worship, and thereupon at the Council
meeting a very warm discussion ensued, during which Mr. C. C.
Aldred was accused of having called Mr. George Danby-Palmer
&ldquo;a liar,&rdquo; and Sir E. H. K. Lacon (by Mr. Henry
Danby-Palmer) of having made a disturbance by &ldquo;kicking
against the panels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>March 1st.&mdash;The following Councillors subsequently
addressed a letter to the Treasury in respect of these
proceedings:&mdash;D. A. Gourlay, H. Danby-Palmer, J. Bayly, R.
Hammond, J. Lettis, junr., J. Fish, W. T. Clarke, J. Barker, P.
Pullyn, J. Jackson, J. D. Chapman, R. Hammond, junr., G.
Danby-Palmer, W. N. Burroughs, C. E. Bartram, M. Butcher, J. G.
Cannell, H. Boulter, P. White, J. Fiddes and J. Pike.</p>
<p>This issue contains the following report of the Sailors&rsquo;
Strike and Riot:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>We have this week to record a riot of a serious
nature arising out of the unfortunate strike among the seamen
who, until recently, had conducted themselves in a manner highly
creditable to so large a body of men placed in such
circumstances.&nbsp; Since the ill-advised rejection, by the men,
of the old agreement as to wages, there have been several
mariners (as there always must be with an over-stocked labour
market) quite ready and glad to sail at different rates to those
proposed by those who struck; and forseeing that if such
defections from their camp continued, their strike would be
unavailing, the sailors have during the last week been in the
habit of parading the Quay, in gangs, for the purpose of
unlawfully preventing such as were willing to go to sea from
joining their ships, and partly by force, and partly by threats,
several men have been deterred from fulfilling their
engagements.&nbsp; Although these facts were known to the
authorities, no steps were taken to put a stop to them, in the
hope that the reasonable and peaceable portion <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>of the
sailors would see how unjustifiable was the course they were
pursuing, and how really destructive it was to the interests both
of the owners and men.&nbsp; The same line of conduct was,
however, continued.&nbsp; The first case brought before the Bench
was that of Samuel Graystone, the mate of the schooner
&ldquo;Ant,&rdquo; belonging to Mr. S. S. Barber, who applied for
the protection of the police, the men having been taken out of
his vessel on Friday afternoon last.&nbsp; On Saturday morning,
Mr. Barber again appeared before the Mayor to complain that the
master and crew of the &ldquo;Maid of the Yare&rdquo; had been
interrupted, and made to go on shore.&nbsp; The master having
come up and corroborated this statement, the crew were sent for
and asked if they were willing to go to sea, having signed
articles.&nbsp; The master and mate said they were, but the men
declined, through fear of personal violence.&nbsp; They were told
that if they did not they must be sent to gaol, but if they were
willing to go they should be protected.&nbsp; They then agreed to
go, and were sent down accordingly with a body of the police; the
master and mate went on board, but the crew refused, and the
police were therefore withdrawn, when some sailors went and
ill-used the mate, throwing him over the bows of his ship on to
the Quay Head.&nbsp; The captain also was pushed on shore.&nbsp;
Subsequently the Bench were informed that the man Graystone had
again been taken out of his vessel, which had gone to sea without
him, and was then lying in Corton Roads.&nbsp; Graystone was sent
for, and said he was not willing to go; but on an information
being taken against him for refusing, he said he would if he
could be protected.&nbsp; A steamtug was therefore ordered to
convey him to his vessel, and on its arriving opposite the Town
Hall at half-past two o&rsquo;clock, the Magistrates agreed,
before taking any other steps, to try whether the police were not
sufficient to protect the men on board, notwithstanding the
evident determination of a large body of sailors to prevent
him.&nbsp; The Superintendent of Police, therefore, arranged the
whole force, and with Graystone in the centre, surrounded by the
Mayor and Magistrates, the escort left the station-house, distant
not more than one hundred yards from the steamtug.&nbsp; When
about half way down, the crowd, which then consisted of about 200
or 300 sailors, set up a tremendous yell and rushed upon the
police, whose ranks were speedily broken, several of the police
and Magistrates being struck.&nbsp; They rallied, and with the
assistance of the Magistrates, who were mainly instrumental in
preventing Graystone from being rescued, they succeeded in
placing him safely on board the tug.&nbsp; The principal
ringleaders were <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>then picked out, and after some considerable struggling
they were got into the station-house.&nbsp; By this time the
concourse of people had increased to upwards of a thousand.&nbsp;
Some of the men then obtained a spar or boom which was brought
opposite the station-house door for the purpose of using it as a
battering ram to release the six or seven prisoners within.&nbsp;
Several stones were thrown, and a few windows broken; upon which
the Mayor immediately swore in as many persons as were willing to
be special constables, and a sally was made upon the mob, and
with considerable difficulty the spar was got away, and one or
two of those who were using it were taken into custody, but being
completely overpowered, the authorities were compelled to retreat
with the force into the station-house.&nbsp; Shortly after, Capt.
Ellis, R.N., having arrived with a body of the coastguardsmen,
armed with muskets, &amp;c., together with some of the men from
the revenue cutter, they took up a position in front of the Hall
and Police-station.&nbsp; The Mayor then read the Riot Act, the
people not dispersing, but on the contrary rather increasing, as
there must then have been several thousands.&nbsp; Mr. G. D.
Palmer addressed a few words to them from the Hall-door,
imploring them to desist from the foolish course they had taken,
and entreating them to disperse peaceably.&nbsp; A stone was then
hurled at the spot where the Magistrates were standing, but it
fortunately did not take effect, and the man who threw it was
instantly secured and brought into the station-house.&nbsp; The
following proclamation was issued by the Mayor:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Borough of Great Yarmouth,
22nd Feb., 1851.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Notice</span>.&mdash;A riot having
this day taken place in this Borough, and the Riot Act having
been read, all peaceable and loyal inhabitants are desired to
keep in their houses until order has been restored.&nbsp; And
notice is hereby further given, that no assemblage of persons
will be allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Charles
Pearson</span>, Mayor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a consultation of the Magistrates, they unanimously
determined to send to Norwich for a troop of the Military
stationed there.&nbsp; A telegraphic message was therefore
despatched, which reached the Norwich Station about half-past
four o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; In the meantime nine of the East
Norfolk Militia located here, under Captain Brown, arrived, and
were speedily followed by detachments of the Coastguard from the
stations at Caister, Winterton, Corton, &amp;c., who were all
sworn in as special constables.&nbsp; The total available force
for the protection of the town now amounted to 201, viz., 90
special constables, 81 officers and men of the revenue cutter and
coastguard, 21 policemen, and 9 militia <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>men; and it
was determined to clear the space in front of the station-house,
which, with much difficulty was accomplished, when the police
succeeded in picking out and taking several of the
ringleaders.</p>
<p>Some persons consider that the people might have been entirely
dispersed without the aid of the military, but considering the
overwhelming number of persons present, it could only have been
accomplished by the armed force charging among the people, which
might have involved much bloodshed, if not actual loss of life,
and there can be no doubt that the authorities exercised a wise
and prudent discretion in contenting themselves by keeping the
crowd as it were at bay, until the arrival of the military, a
troop of which, consisting of 35 of the 11th Hussars, under
Captain Douglas, reached the Yarmouth station by special train at
about a quarter to six in the evening.&nbsp; A great mob of
people had assembled at the terminus, and the officer in command
refused to enter the town unless accompanied by a magistrate on
horseback.&nbsp; J. C. Smith, Esq., accordingly having gone down,
the troop, a little before seven o&rsquo;clock, entered the town
and cantering their horses over the quay and pavements, the crowd
which had remained in front of the Police-court fled in every
direction, some of them in their anxiety to escape the too near
approach of the soldiers&rsquo; swords, actually running over one
another.&nbsp; Several women were knocked down by the mob in
their flight, but we believe no injuries, beyond a few broken
heads and bruised limbs, were received by any one.&nbsp; Great
numbers of persons, however, secreted themselves by the river
side, and in the ends of the numerous narrow rows in the town,
under the impression that the military could not dislodge
them.&nbsp; The Mayor, however, having issued orders for the
entire quay to be cleared, the police, aided by a strong body of
special constables, were for some hours engaged in dispersing the
knots of people who had collected in these localities; patrols of
the military and the police were then placed at all the principal
thoroughfares leading to the Town Hall, which had been the scene
of the riot, for the purpose of stopping all persons from coming
that way.&nbsp; About eleven o&rsquo;clock order having been,
comparatively speaking, restored, the Magistrates consulted with
the commanding-officer, and it was agreed that the military
(which now numbered 75 in all, having been joined by another
troop) should retire to their quarters, holding themselves in
readiness to be called out at a minute&rsquo;s warning.&nbsp; The
police were sent on their regular beats, but the cutter&rsquo;s
men and coastguardsmen remained at the Hall during the whole of
the Saturday night, as did also the special <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>constables,
who were divided into three divisions, under regular captains,
for the purpose of relieving each other every four hours.&nbsp;
At half-past nine on Sunday morning, the Mayor and Magistrates
again assembled, but as everything had passed off quietly during
the night, and as there did not seem any disposition on the part
of the persons who were collected round the Hall (more by
curiosity than otherwise) to commit any breach of the peace, the
special constables, with most of the coastguardsmen were released
from further duty until they should be again summoned, if
required, by the alarm bell.&nbsp; At the close of the
morning&rsquo;s service the Magistrates held a further
consultation, when it was determined to draw up a report of the
occurrences which had taken place, and to transmit the same to
Sir G. Grey, the Secretary of the Home Department, to whom it was
suggested that it would be advisable that a war steamer should be
sent down to the port until order was entirely restored.</p>
<p>We cannot conclude our report without bearing our testimony to
the great and extraordinary exertions to maintain peace and order
made by our excellent Chief Magistrate, ably supported as he was
by everyone of his brother Magistrates, and to the firmness and
determination displayed by the Authorities may be mainly
attributed to the preservation of the public peace, and the
prompt and effectual suppression of the riotious spirit displayed
by some thoughtless and illadvised men.&nbsp; It could hardly
have been supposed that any friends of order could have been
found ready to cast any blame upon the Authorities for the wise
precautions they took, but we regret to say that some persons
who, instead of coming forward to assist in preserving the public
peace, kept, to their shame, in their own houses, and who,
entirely ignorant of the organisation which was on foot, presume
to censure those whom they should have been the first to
support.&nbsp; Such parties are, however, we trust, but few, for
we feel sure that the course pursued on the present occasion by
the Authorities, will receive the unqualified approval and
sanction of all the peaceably disposed and loyal inhabitants of
the town.&nbsp; The conduct of the Police force&mdash;as well as
that of the special constables&mdash;was most meritorious and
praiseworthy; some of the former especially distinguished
themselves for their courageous conduct, but it would be
invidious to make any distinction between them, as all the men in
the force are equally deserving of praise.&nbsp; They exercised
the greatest forbearance, being most grossly insulted and
ill-used, notwithstanding which they abstained from using their
staves until the spirit of riot being openly manifested, they
were directed to use them by their excellent superintendent,
Capt. B. Love.&nbsp; Police-constable <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>Fuller has been very seriously
injured, it being feared that some of his ribs are broken;
another man who was engaged in the cowardly act of beating
Police-constable Johnson while on the ground, in his turn
received a blow from the truncheon of one of the special
constables, which inflicted a very serious wound on his
head.&nbsp; Many other persons were hurt in the course of the
riot, but not that we can learn to any serious extent.&nbsp; It
is said, however, that a man was severely wounded in the hand by
the sword of one of the soldiers, he having seized the bridle and
nearly thrown the latter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the succeeding Monday the several cases were dealt with

own recognizances for &pound;68 each.</p>
<p>H.M. ships &ldquo;Black Eagle&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Lightning&rdquo; had entered the Harbour and laid on the
west side of the river.</p>
<p>The Workhouse (which unfortunately contained a large number of
idle and dissolute characters) had been the scene of frequent
disturbances, and police had been lodged there on that
account.&nbsp; During the riot an outbreak, however, had taken
place, and a ringleader named Charles Girdlestone taken into
custody; he was sentenced to 42 days&rsquo; hard labour <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>for this
offence, and would be sent for trial for a ferocious attack on
the police.&nbsp; Three other paupers had been sent to the
treadmill for 21 days each for refractory conduct.</p>
<p>March 8th.&mdash;At the Quarter Sessions, (held before N.
Palmer, Esq.), the rioters, John Creak (24), Benjamin Mallett
(34), John Brooks (19), William Bee (26), and Robert Willgrass
(&mdash;), were put upon their trial.</p>
<p>Mr. Hotson (with whom was Mr. Mills and Mr. Bulwer)
prosecuted, and Mr. Evans (with whom was Mr. C. Cooper) defended
the prisoners, the Jury (having deliberated for 25 minutes)
returned a verdict of Not Guilty, &ldquo;which verdict was
received with a loud burst of applause, which lasted two or three
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>March 15th.&mdash;The strike had ended, most of the owners
having consented to sign agreements for giving the men the wages
they asked for, for a period of 12 months.</p>
<p>March 22nd.&mdash;The sailors had held a &ldquo;Grand
Procession with flags, banners, and triumphant cars.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the latter were several men attired as Neptune, Britannia,
&amp;c., in the evening they attended at the Vauxhall Gardens,
where there was a grand display of fireworks.&mdash;During the
strike 500 stones of flour, 600 lbs. of beef, and 500 cwt. of
coals, had been distributed amongst the families of the men on
strike from the contributions of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The N.A.O.D. had met at the Trinity Arms to celebrate the 10th
anniversary of the Trinity Lodge, No. 220.&nbsp; Messrs. R. R. B.
Norman, J. P. Hastings, P.A., and F. Palmer took part in the
proceedings.&mdash;It was stated there were then three lodges of
this order in the town.</p>
<p>April 5th.&mdash;Mr. Ferrier and Sir E. H. K. Lacon had
appealed, without success, against the rating of certain property
on the Denes, on the ground &ldquo;that it was not within the
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was proposed to form a &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo; Steam Tug
Company (capital, &pound;1,000 in &pound;5 shares.)</p>
<p>George Danby-Palmer and J. Barker, Esqs., had been elected
Haven Commissioners, and D. A. Gourlay and R. Hammond, Esqs.,
Supernumerary Haven Commissioners.</p>

yacht.</p>
<p>Captain James Day had been fined &pound;5 for assaulting Mr.
Nolloth, tailor.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Public Heath Act&rdquo; was again being discussed
by the Town Council, where Mr. Burroughs moved, and Mr. Barker
seconded, a petition against the application of the Act to the
Borough, and Mr. F. Worship moved, and Mr. R. Ferrier, jun.,
seconded as an amendment that the Council pass to the next
business on the agenda paper.</p>
<p>Upon a division the amendment was lost by 15 to 23, and the
original motion declared to be carried by 23 to 17 votes.</p>
<p>April 26th.&mdash;At a meeting held at the Angel-inn (C. J.
Palmer, Esq., in the chair) it was thought desirable &ldquo;to
advertise the town, and that a saxhorn band should play daily on
the principal promenades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 10th.&mdash;The pilots of Gorleston had succeeded in
establishing a Tug Company, and had purchased a boat of 45
horsepower, called &ldquo;The Royal Albert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>J. Hume, Esq., M.P., had introduced a deputation of Ratepayers
opposed to the &ldquo;Public Health Act&rdquo; to Lord Seymour
(at the Woods and Forests Office); it consisted of Charles
Pearson, Esq., (Mayor); D. A. Gourlay, Esq., (Deputy-Mayor);
George Danby-Palmer, Esq., and William N. Burroughs, Esq., with
Mr. J. H. Harrison (Secretary), while 18 members of the Council
at the same time petitioned Parliament in favour of the
measure.</p>

<p>Increase of population per cent., 10.3.&nbsp; This included
347 inmates of the Workhouse.</p>
<p>It was noted that in 1619 Manship estimated the then
population of the town at 1,200 households, which would give a
population of some 7,000.</p>
<p>In 1724 a writer named Andrews stated the population at 13,000
or 14,000; and in 1784 when it was first accurately taken, it was
found to be 12,608.</p>
<p>The then returns were considered disappointing, as it was
expected that the town contained 30,000 persons, but it was noted
that 2,500 sailors belonged to the port, half of whom were
probably not at home when the return was made.</p>
<p>At this time Gorleston had a population of 2,586, and
Southtown of 1,412 persons.</p>
<p>John Annison, the driver of the Sutton coach, had been
convicted for the fourth time of conveying passengers to Yarmouth
at a greater speed than four miles an hour without having a
number plate on his vehicle, and fined &pound;10 with &pound;3
3s. costs.</p>
<p>May 31st.&mdash;Visitors were beginning to arrive.</p>
<p>June 7th.&mdash;A project was on foot for laying out the
Chapel Denes as an ornamental walk for the public.</p>
<p>June 28th.&mdash;A mushroom measuring 29 inches in
circumference, with a stalk about the thickness of a man&rsquo;s
wrist and weighing 2&frac12;lbs., had been grown at Bradwell.</p>
<p>James Gedge, a pauper lunatic, had escaped from the Workhouse,
having only a shirt on.</p>
<p>July 5th.&mdash;A Bill had been brought in by Lord Seymour and
Mr. Cornewall Lewis confirming the provisional order to applying
the provisions of the Board of Health Act to the town.</p>
<p>July 19th.&mdash;A petition, signed by 1,550 persons, had been
presented to the House, and a deputation had waited on Lord John
Russell with regard to this action of the Government.</p>
<p>The M.P&rsquo;s. for the town being in favour of the measure,
&ldquo;had been requested to resign the trust they had
abused.&rdquo;&nbsp; This action emanated <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>from a
public meeting of ratepayers, over which.&nbsp; George
Danby-Palmer, Esq., presided, and at which Mr. S. W. Bly, Mr. A.
Ames, Mr. W. N. Burroughs, Mr. S. V. Moore, Mr. R. Hammond, and
Mr. T. Parker took part.</p>
<p>July 26th.&mdash;The Bill nevertheless passed through
Committee by a majority of 92 against 12.</p>
<p>Sir J. Walmsley had opposed and Lord Seymour supported the
measure, but eventually it passed the House of Commons without a
division.</p>
<p>The paupers were much dissatisfied at not being allowed, as
formerly, to attend places of Worship in the town on Sundays.</p>
<p>Mr. C. Houchen had delivered an address on this subject, and
denounced the action of the Guardians.</p>
<p>Aug. 9th.&mdash;It was computed that many hundreds of children
in the North District were entirely without the opportunity for
instruction, and it was proposed to fit up the Priory as a
National School to meet this want.</p>
<p>Evidence had been taken by the Committee of the House of Lords
upon the Public Health Bill being applied to the town, and they
reported the Bill to the House without amendment; thus there was
a &ldquo;speedy prospect of the town being well drained and made
clean and healthy in spite of its one-idead rulers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Smyth, R.N., had been raised to the rank of
Post-Captain.</p>
<p>Six hundred and thirty electors had signed a requisition
calling on Messrs. Rumbold and Saunders to resign their seats as
M.P&rsquo;s. for the Borough.&nbsp; This would form a majority of
the voters.</p>
<p>The East Norfolk and Suffolk Horticultural Show had been held
under the patronage of the Mayoress, Lady Lacon, and Mr. S. C. J.
Palmer.</p>
<p>Aug. 16th.&mdash;The 279th, and last, meeting of the Paving
Commissioners had been held, when there were

Harrison, S. V. Moore, P. White, J. Cobb, W. Crow, I. Lettis,
jun., and W. H. Bessey.</p>
<p>Mr. Beeching&rsquo;s newly-built lifeboat had been submitted
to several tests opposite the Crane.</p>
<p>Aug. 23rd.&mdash;Mr. Beeching&rsquo;s model had obtained the
prize in the Lifeboat Competition at Somerset House.&nbsp; There
were 280 models and plans sent in, the first six boats
being&mdash;James Beeching, Great Yarmouth; Henry Hinks,
Appledore; J. and E. Pellew, Newbury; William <a

Great Yarmouth; Harvey and Son, Ipswich, and George Farrow, South
Shields.</p>
<p>Aug. 30th.&mdash;The Licensed Victuallers had held a large and
important meeting for the purpose of protecting their interests,
S. C. Marsh, Esq., in the chair.</p>
<p>Mr. G. Blyth (Reporter to the <i>Norfolk News</i>) had been
induced to visit at night a tower in the South-End of the town,
belonging to George Danby-Palmer, Esq., when he had been
assaulted by some person there, and of this he had complained to
the Bench.</p>
<p>Sept. 13th.&mdash;The Justices had refused to grant any fresh
licenses at the Brewster Sessions.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Reindeer&rdquo; yawl (manned by Beachmen) had
challenged the &ldquo;America&rdquo; yacht to sail for
&pound;105.</p>
<p>Sept. 20th.&mdash;The Council meeting had been broken up,
leaving 20 subjects undisposed of, owing to all the Conservatives
and two or three of the Liberal members leaving the meeting,
which was thus reduced below the required number to form a
&ldquo;quorum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sept. 27th.&mdash;Mr. Hilling had been appointed Town Surveyor
at a salary of &pound;30 per annum, and &pound;250 had been
proposed as the salary of the Town-Clerk, he also acting as Clerk
to the newly-formed Local Board of Health.&nbsp; Mr. Clowes,
however, declined to give his assent to serve on these terms
without further consideration.</p>
<p>Oct. 4th.&mdash;There had been heavy gales and the Roadstead
presented &ldquo;a most lamentable scene, crowded with shipping,
which had put in for refuge to the number of some
hundreds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the vessels belonging to the Franklin Exploration
Expedition were in the Roads.</p>
<p>Oct. 11th.&mdash;Harris Wilshak had been charged with being
concerned in smuggling 14lbs. of tobacco.</p>
<p>At the Revision Court Mr. F. S. Costerton appeared for the
Liberals, and Mr. C. Preston for the Tories.&nbsp; Neither party
claimed any gain from the proceedings on the Parliamentary Lists,
but on the Burgess Roll the Liberals claimed a gain of 19, of
which 15 were in the Regent-ward, where a very warm contest was
expected in November.</p>
<p>Oct. 18th.&mdash;Mr. J. W. Crowe had been elected Surgeon to
the Hospital School.</p>
<p>The new Valuation Lists had increased the assessment of the
parish by &pound;47,000.</p>
<p>Active preparations were being made for the Municipal
contests.</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Mr.
Wilshak had been acquitted on the charge of smuggling.</p>
<p>George Deacon, known as &ldquo;The Prophet,&rdquo; had thrown
himself into the river, as he stated that it was impossible that
he should sink; he would have been drowned but for the help of
the bystanders.&nbsp; When taken to the Station House he was
found to have &pound;18, 2 old gold coins, and 21s. 6d. upon
him.</p>
<p>Oct. 25th.&mdash;The Priory was being fitted for National
Schools.</p>
<p>Houchen, who had been preaching against &ldquo;the powers that
be,&rdquo; had been bound over to keep the peace in two sureties
of &pound;25 and himself in &pound;50.</p>
<p>Nov. 8th.&mdash;The Municipal Election had been hotly
contested and the partizans of the winning party (the Tories)
made it &ldquo;a boast of having expended in the five wards a sum
of money variously stated from &pound;800 to
&pound;1,200.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following was the return given
with the poll of 1850 appended to it:&mdash;</p>

&ldquo;runners&rdquo; with some &ldquo;dust&rdquo; turned the

<p>Great exertions were used to secure the return of the
out-going Councillors, and it having been almost publicly stated
that the Conservatives were determined to win &ldquo;at any
cost,&rdquo; votes, in consequence, got up the night before the
election to a very high premium&mdash;from &pound;5 to &pound;15;
and &ldquo;split&rdquo; votes even were in very great demand at
&pound;8 and &pound;10.&nbsp; One case is mentioned of a voter,
in another Ward, who, forseeing the value which votes would
attain, speculated in the purchase of one in this a month before
the election, at the trifling sum of &pound;3, and so profitable
was the investment that on the election morning he sold it for
&pound;10.&nbsp; The money spent in this Ward was stated at
&pound;350.</p>

<p>This Ward was contested, but in rather a peculiar way, for
although it was supposed that some opposition to the outgoing
Councillors would be made, it was treated by the Conservatives as
a &ldquo;sham&rdquo; one, and such it really seemed up to 12
o&rsquo;clock, when the state of the poll came out with <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>upwards of
100 for Messrs. Miller and Palmer, and only about two votes for
each of their opponents!&nbsp; This, however, was only a <i>ruse
de guerre</i>, and in a short time the voters came up almost in a
body for Messrs. Harrison and Sterry, who stated in their address
that in &ldquo;the short space of four hours they obtained 97
promises,&rdquo; and had they been sooner in the field it is
thought they would have met with better success.</p>
<p>The result of the Elections has been a gain to the
Conservative party of two seats, and this reduces the two parties
to a level in the Council; the Liberals have still, however, a
bare majority, and it is doubted whether they will not be able to
carry the Mayoralty for another year.&nbsp; The Conservatives, it
is said, intend nominating either Sir E. H. K. Lacon, or (which
is more likely) Mr. S. C. Marsh for that office, whilst the names
of Alderman E. R. Palmer and Alderman Bartram are spoken of by
the Liberals.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Norwich, attended by the Rev. S. Hills and his
chaplain, had inspected the Priory buildings, when they were
received by J. H. Hakewell, Esq., (the architect) and C. J.
Palmer, Esq., (the hon. secretary to the Committee).</p>
<p>Mr. Worlledge had moved the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench for a
&ldquo;<i>quo warranto</i>&rdquo; to try the legality of Mr.
Hammond&rsquo;s election as a Councillor for the St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Ward, and the rule had been granted.</p>
<p>Nov. 15th.&mdash;The Hospital was badly supported, and it was
stated that unless &pound;150 a year in additional subscriptions
could be obtained, the assistance afforded to sufferers must be
abridged.</p>
<p>A lecture on &ldquo;Bloomerism&rdquo; had been delivered by
Mrs. Knights at the Corn Hall in full &ldquo;Bloomer&rdquo;
costume, but she did not appear to have achieved a marked
success.</p>
<p>Dr. Wolff (the traveller) had offered to give some lectures in
the town in aid of the National Priory Schools.</p>
<p>At the Town Council for the Election of Mayor, a great crowd
assembled prior to the meeting, when Sir E. K. Lacon proposed,
and Mr. Fenn seconded, S. C. Marsh, Esq., to fill that office,
and Mr. George Danby-Palmer moved, and Mr. R. Hammond seconded,
the re-election of Captain Charles Pearson, R.N.&nbsp; Upon the
votes being taken, there appeared for Captain
Pearson&mdash;Aldermen Pearson, Boulter, Bartram, Bayly, Fiddes,
Hammond, Pike, R. Hammond, jun., E. R. Palmer, and Barker;
Councillors Burroughs, Butcher, Cannell, Clarke, Chapman, Fish,
Gourlay, Impey, Jackson, Lettis, Moore, G. D. Palmer, and P.
White; total, 23.&nbsp; For Mr. Marsh&mdash;Alderman B. Fenn;
Councillors <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>C. Aldred, E. Aldred, Barber, Bessey, Cherry, Ferrier,
Ferrier, jun., J. Fenn, W. Hammond, B. Jay, H. Jay, Lacon, Marsh,
S. Miller, Nightingale, W. H. Palmer, Plummer, Preston, Smith,
Steward, F. Worship, and W. Worship; total, 23.&nbsp; And the
Mayor, giving a casting vote for himself, declared himself duly
elected.&nbsp; Subsequently the Town Clerk (Mr. John Clowes)
declared that he would not continue in that office at the salary
of &pound;250, and it having been stated that Mr. Charles Cory
would accept it on those terms, he was elected Town Clerk by 23
against 15 voices.&nbsp; Mr. Cory then attended, was informed of
his election, and an order made on the late Clerk to hand over
the papers relating to the office to him.&nbsp; In conclusion,
the Editor expressed a hope that &ldquo;on no future occasion
will any parties be allowed to violate order and decorum in a way
so disgraceful as they did on Monday last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nov. 22nd.&mdash;A dinner had been given to the Mayor at the
Star-hotel, when 45 members of the Council and others
attended.</p>
<p>A Poor&rsquo;s Rate of 1s. 2d. in the &pound; had been
made.&nbsp; Great dissatisfaction existed as to the new
assessment of the parish.</p>
<p>Nov. 29th.&mdash;Mr. Joseph Sandars, M.P., had issued a reply
to the requisition of the electors, justifying the course he had
taken with regard to the Public Health Act.</p>
<p>A meeting had been held with regard to the new assessment, Mr.
J. H. Harrison in the chair.</p>
<p>The town had been visited with a tremendous gale, during which
several vessels had been blown out to sea.&nbsp; At the time of
the storm there were 700 sail between this port and
Lowestoft.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Enterprise,&rdquo; 600 tons, had been launched from
Mr. Branford&rsquo;s Yard; she was christened by Miss Barber and
Miss Holt.</p>
<p>Dec. 6th.&mdash;A public meeting had been held at the
Town-hall (Mr. J. H. Harrison in the chair) for the purpose of
considering the Poor&rsquo;s Rate assessment recently made.&nbsp;
About 400 persons attended, when the same was condemned, and a
subscription commenced for the purpose of disputing the validity
of it.</p>
<p>In respect of such proceedings, Mr. F. S. Costerton had been
engaged as solicitor to the owners of small tenements, and Mr. C.
H. Chamberlin for the general body of appellants, estimated at
from 500 to 600 in number at the least.</p>
<p>Dec. 13th.&mdash;At the special meeting of the Town Council,
&ldquo;a scene of much disorder and confusion arose out of some
recriminations relative the late Town-Clerk, between Mr.
Burroughs and Mr. Preston.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Dec.
20th.&mdash;On the hearing of the assessment appeals, the rate
was quashed by the Justices on the ground of unequal
assessment.&nbsp; In these proceedings Mr. Chamberlin appeared on

<p>&ldquo;The defendant, John Eagleton, a baker, at Yarmouth, who
had contracted with the Guardians of Yarmouth to supply the poor
with bread, was tried before the Recorder, N. Palmer, Esq., at
the Quarter Sessions in March, 1854, upon an indictment charging
him, in the seven <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>first counts, with an offence at common law, in
fraudulently supplying the poor with bread of short weight; and,
in the three last counts, with attempting to obtain payment from
the Guardians, by falsely pretending that he had supplied full
weight.&nbsp; He was found guilty by the jury, but the Recorder
reserved a case for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal,
as to the proprietory of the conviction in point of law.&nbsp; On
the first argument on April 29th, 1854, before Pollock, C.B.,
Parke, B., Creswell, J., and Williams, J., the case was referred
back to the Recorder, for him to state the whole evidence given
at the trial, which he did accordingly, and the case, as
re-stated, was, on the following 3rd of June, argued before Lord
Campbell, C. J., Alderson, B., Coleridge, J., Martin, B., and
Crowder, J., and they, having doubts as to the proprietory of the
conviction, desired the case to be argued before the 15 judges,
and on the 2nd December, 1854, it was argued before Jervis, C.
J., Pollock, C. B., Parke, B., Maule, J., Wightman, J., Erle, J.,
Platt, B., Martin, B., and Crompton, J., and again on the 3rd of
February last, before Jervis, C. J., Parke, B., Maule, J.,
Wightman, J., Creswell, J., Erle, J., Platt, B., Williams, J.,
Martin, B., and Crompton, J.&mdash;Mr. Bulwer appeared in support
of the conviction, and Mr. Bodkin, Mr. Clerk, and Mr. J. H. Mills
on behalf of the Defendant.&nbsp; The Judges took time to
consider, and on July the 9th, Mr. Baron Parke delivered their
judgment, affirming the conviction on the last three
counts.&nbsp; The defendant will, therefore, have to appear
before the Recorder at the next October Sessions to receive
judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Feb. 25th.&mdash;A case which excited considerable interest,
had been heard at the County Court, Tolhouse-hall, before the
Judge (T. J. Birch, Esq.)&nbsp; The plaintiff was Mr. John Cobb,
leather merchant, for whom Mr. C. H. Chamberlin appeared; the
defendants were Messrs. W. N. Burroughs and G. D. Palmer, who
were represented by Mr. J. L. Cufaude.&nbsp; The plaintiff stated
that he was a candidate for the office of Councillor for the
Market-ward, in November, 1851, and that he became such at the
solicitation of Messrs. W. N. Burroughs and G. D. Palmer.&nbsp;
At the time he became a candidate he distinctly told them that he
would not pay out of his own pocket more than &pound;10 towards
the expenses of the election, and it was understood that the
Liberal party, to which he belonged, would subscribe the
remainder.&nbsp; The evening before the election he received an
estimate of what the expenses were likely to be, and in
consequence of that he at once saw both Mr. Burroughs and Mr. G.
D. Palmer.&nbsp; That estimate, he believed, amounted to about
&pound;45, while the subscriptions altogether amounted to but
&pound;42.&nbsp; After some conversation they agreed to hold him
harmless of the amount of the expenses that might exceed the sum
subscribed, and he and Mr. Burroughs then went <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>to the
Committee-room of the North-ward, where Mr. Burroughs said they
had made arrangements for their friend John Cobb winning the
Market-ward.&nbsp; The expenses of the election, which he (the
plaintiff) lost, amounted altogether to &pound;58 1s. 7d.&nbsp;
The balance, therefore, which he now claimed from the defendants
was &pound;16 1s. 7d.&mdash;The plaintiff, in cross-examination
by Mr. Cufaude, admitted that &pound;39 of the whole amount was
for &mdash; &mdash;.&mdash;Mr. Cufaude contended that if, as the
plaintiff stated, the defendants had given him a guarantee for
the surplus expenses, the guarantee ought to have been in
writing.&nbsp; And, assuming the evidence was true, which,
however, he disputed, it was impossible for the plaintiff to
recover, inasmuch as he himself had allowed that a large part of
the whole of the expenses was for &mdash; &mdash;, which was an
illegal act.&mdash;Mr. Chamberlin contended that the plaintiff,
after receiving the promise from the defendants, acted only upon
the faith of that promise, and that therefore, as they had
entered upon an engagement to pay the money, they were
liable.&nbsp; The money, moreover, had not been spent by the
plaintiff, but by the committee appointed to conduct the
election, and until the election was over, the plaintiff was not
aware that any of the money had been spent in &mdash;
&mdash;.&mdash;His Honour said it was clear the guarantee should
have been in writing.&nbsp; He was of opinion, also, that the
plaintiff was not bound to pay the illegal charges, and
consequently he could not bring his action for the money which he
claimed.&mdash;The plaintiff was, accordingly, non-suited.</p>
<p>March 4th.&mdash;The &ldquo;Branch,&rdquo; a schooner of 150

<p>Oct. 21st.&mdash;Contains the following report:&mdash;&ldquo;A
Vestry meeting was held in the Town-hall, on Friday, for the
purpose of considering the propriety of making a Church
rate.&nbsp; There was a large attendance; the minister of the
parish (the Rev. G. Hills, B.D.), of course presided.&mdash;The
Chairman, in opening the proceedings, stated that the rate which
would be proposed would be, in all respects, a legal one; it
would include a charge for St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, as the
Churchwardens had been advised that that edifice was chargeable
upon the rate in the same way that the Parish Church was.&nbsp;
With regard to the new church of St. John&rsquo;s, a fund had
been raised which would be invested for keeping it in repair, so
that it might never become chargeable to the parishioners.&nbsp;
The Churchwardens, in order to preserve as much harmony as
possible, would only ask for a rate for the repair of the
fabrics, and for the payment of such legal charges as they were
compelled to include in the rate; the <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>items which would be left out would,
therefore, amount to between &pound;60 and &pound;70, and would
have to be defrayed by voluntary contribution.&mdash;Messrs. C.
S. D. Steward and E. R. Aldred, the Churchwardens, moved and
seconded that a rate of 1&frac12;d. in the pound be levied for
the ensuing year; the amounts which it was estimated would be
required were&mdash;for the Parish Church, &pound;142 5s. 4d.;
for St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, &pound;32 6s. 6d.; for St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church &pound;32; and for general purposes
&pound;35.&mdash;Mr. W. T. Fisher moved, and Mr. J. Lawn
seconded, &ldquo;That at a time when it is expected that the
Government will pass a bill for the abolition of Church rates, it
appears to this vestry that it is inexpedient to increase the
rates by including St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, as it may ultimately
add to increased taxation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Fisher also moved,
and Mr. Joseph Neave seconded, &ldquo;That time be given for the
ratepayers to examine the estimates, and that the meeting do
therefore adjourn for three weeks for that
purpose.&rdquo;&mdash;The Chairman refused to put either of the
above amendments&mdash;the first because Mr. Fisher would not
alter it by leaving out the words &ldquo;By including St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church,&rdquo; and the second because he did not
consider it to be a <i>bona fide</i> objection.&mdash;Mr. Fisher
entered written protests, signed by himself, against the decision
of the chairman, which protests he requested might be entered in
the Vestry Clerk&rsquo;s minutes of the meeting.&mdash;Mr. J. H.
Harrison moved, &ldquo;That until after the committee, which was
appointed in April last to confer with the Churchwardens relative
to the property belonging to the Parish Church, had made its
report to a further vestry, it is inexpedient to make a
rate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. F. Starling seconded the
amendment.&mdash;The Chairman, in endeavouring to prevail upon
Mr. Harrison to withdraw his amendment, stated that in March
next, property which now let at from &pound;29 to &pound;30 a
year, and that in September, 1859, property which now realised
&pound;50 per annum, would fall in; he agreed with them that the
greatest care ought to be taken in properly administering this
property, and said he believed its value would be increased
threefold.&mdash;The amendment was carried by an immense
majority, and the meeting, therefore, was adjourned <i>sine
die</i>.</p>
<p>Oct. 28th.&mdash;Many vessels had been lost, and amongst them
the &ldquo;Betsy&rdquo; (G. D. Palmer, Esq., owner), on Palling
Beach.&nbsp; (N.B.&mdash;She was at that time the oldest vessel

family for more than 100 years.)</p>

<p>Mr. J. Clowes had entered a protest against the return in the
Nelson Ward &ldquo;on the ground of the presiding alderman having
left his post during the election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nov. 7th.&mdash;The first general meeting of the Shareholders
of the Britannia Pier Company had been held, the accounts showing
&pound;1,365 received, and &pound;781 12s. 6d expended.</p>
<p>Nov. 11th.&mdash;At the Council Meeting, Mr. E. H. L. Preston
proposed, and Mr. Palmer (Deputy-Mayor) seconded, Mr. Francis
Worship for the office of Mayor.&nbsp; Mr. R. Steward then
proposed Mr. W. H. Bessey, who declining the honour, Mr. Steward
suggested the name of Mr. Plummer, who also refusing to serve,
the Mayor declared Mr. Worship unanimously elected to the
office.</p>
<p>The Poor&rsquo;s rate was 1s. 4d. in the &pound;.</p>
<p>Nov. 14th.&mdash;Thirty-six gentlemen had attended the dinner
given to the Ex-Mayor at the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Herring was selling at from &pound;12 to &pound;20 a last.</p>
<p>The adjourned Vestry Meeting for the purpose of considering
the propriety of making a Church rate had been held in the Town
Hall.&nbsp; There was a large attendance of ratepayers, who were,
of course, presided over by the minister of the parish.&nbsp; The
Committee appointed to consider the value of the Church property
recommended that that which had fallen in, and which would fall
in on the 25th of March next, should be re-let on repairing
leases of 14 years&rsquo; duration, at a rental of &pound;76
16s.&mdash;Mr. J. H. Harrison, one of the committee, gave a
detailed account of all the Church property, both of that which
fell in in September last, and that which will fall in during
next year and 1859 and 1860.&nbsp; He had no doubt, whatever,
that if the property was properly managed, there would be no
necessity for asking for a Church rate after 1860.&mdash;Mr. C.
S. D. Steward and Mr. E. R. Aldred, the Churchwardens, moved and
seconded respectively, &ldquo;That in consequence of the
increased rental of the estate belonging to St. Nicholas&rsquo;
Church not being available for the current year, a rate of
1&frac12;d in the pound be now made and
assessed.&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. J. H. Harrison thought that St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church ought not to be included in the rate, and
moved as an <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>amendment, &ldquo;That St. Peter&rsquo;s Church having
been erected by voluntary contributions, with an understanding
that it should be maintained and supported by its pew rents, and
should in no way become a charge upon the parish, this Vestry
deems it advisable to refuse making a rate until the
Churchwardens do exclude the said Church of St. Peter wholly from
their estimate.&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. J. Lawn seconded the amendment,
but the Chairman refused to put it, on the ground that he could
not consistently with his duty do so.&mdash;After considerable
discussion, in the course of which the Clerk stated that St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church could be legally included in the rate, Mr.
W. T. Fisher moved, and Mr. J. Lawn seconded, on the ground that
the Church property, if re-let at its full value, would realize
more than sufficient for the necessary repairs of the Parish
Church, and that money, which could afterwards be repaid out of
the surplus, could be borrowed to defray the expenses for the
next two years,&mdash;&ldquo;That this meeting resolves to
adjourn for four weeks, to obtain the necessary amount and
thereby to avoid the necessity of making a Church
rate.&rdquo;&mdash;The Chairman conscientiously refused to put
this amendment on the ground that it was not a <i>bona fide</i>
one, and also the following amendment, which was likewise moved
by Mr. W. T. Fisher, &ldquo;That in order to give the
Churchwardens time to prepare a proper estimate, the Vestry to
adjourn for three weeks.&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. J. H. Harrison then
moved, &ldquo;That it is inexpedient and inadvisable to make a
Church rate at this meeting.&rdquo;&mdash;The Chairman, however,
refused to put this, as also another amendment by Mr. J. H.
Harrison to the effect, &ldquo;That a Church rate of a farthing
in the pound be levied.&rdquo;&mdash;After a great deal of
uproar, the motion of the Churchwardens was lost by a
considerable majority.&nbsp; A poll was then demanded, when the
Chairman appointed Mr. J. L. Cufaude to be the assessor, and the
meeting adjourned.&nbsp; The following numbers were polled during
the afternoon:&mdash;For the rate 225, against it 195.</p>
<p>Nov. 18th.&mdash;The polling of the Vestry had been concluded
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>1858.</h3>
<p>Jan. 2nd.&mdash;Contains the following article on the Old
Year:&mdash;&ldquo;1857 has been a good year for our port.&nbsp;
Our fisheries have prospered; our mercantile and shipping report
is favourable; and our commercial credit has stood firm and
upright against the pressure of a severe monetary crisis.&nbsp;
We have proved the elasticity of our resources, and have
demonstrated the strength and stability of our enterprise.&nbsp;
The fashionable season has also been one on which we have to
congratulate ourselves.&nbsp; During the summer and autumn of
1857, Yarmouth was <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>full of visitors; our beach was crowded with company;
and our hotels and lodging houses were all full.&nbsp; In short,
on New Year&rsquo;s Day we find that we can strike a balance on
the right side, and look forward with hope based on the solid
foundation of proved success.&nbsp; There is but one great
drawback to the seasonable satisfaction such a state of things
affords.&nbsp; Our political divisions have materially diminished
the account in our favour, and have seriously interfered with the
social harmony of the town.&nbsp; We have suffered ourselves to
be led away into personal altercations, and have so departed from
the straight road of a defined and thought-out principle.&nbsp;
This has been a grave mistake, as we are now beginning to
discover.&nbsp; But generally we have yet to learn that political
zeal is not inconsistent with the courtesies of society, and that
ill-tempered advocacy is worse than useless.&nbsp; Let us hope,
however, that the moderate men of both political opinions, who
must, we are sure, see the error of this course, will for the
future guard against indiscretions, which are as inherently wrong
as they are manifestly prejudicial to any cause that stands upon
Principle and is supported by its own Truth.&nbsp; We know we
express the opinion of the thinking portion of the constituency
in advising an abstinence from the littleness of factious strife,
and in suggesting a more elevated view of political verities, we
are satisfied we are answering to the wish of the most
respectable members of the opposing parties, and are explaining
what is only wanting to consolidate the established prosperity of
Yarmouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hospital meeting showed a deficit of from &pound;40 to
&pound;50 on the annual accounts.</p>
<p>Jan. 6th.&mdash;It was rumoured than an addition would shortly

memorial to the Lord Chancellor, deprecating the proposed
appointment of Messrs. P. Pullyn, D. A. Gourlay, Frederick
Palmer, William T. Clarke, John Barker, and John Owles, and Mr.
George Danby-Palmer moved, and Mr. Chapman seconded, an amendment
in favour of such appointments, which, on a division, was lost by
25 to 5 votes.&nbsp; The Mayor made some warm remarks of a
personal nature, which brought a similar retort from Mr. Chapman,
and it was stated that &ldquo;the last portion of these remarks
was given amid applause in the gallery and laughter of the
members, the meeting breaking up in great confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feb. 6th.&mdash;The same question had been discussed at a
meeting of Magistrates, when the Clerk was directed to apply to
the Lord Chancellor for the correspondence with regard to the
proposed appointments.</p>

&ldquo;scene&rdquo; had ensued.</p>
<p>March 20th.&mdash;The Naval Hospital was being fitted up for
the reception of sick and wounded men from India; it was noticed
that although fitted up in a similar way during the Russian war,
it had never then been used.</p>
<p>Complaint was made of the &ldquo;niggardly&rdquo; way in which
the Southtown Road was lighted.</p>
<p>March 24th.&mdash;Lord Sondes had presented a petition from
the Town Council to the House of Lords on the subject of the
Magisterial appointments, but after an explanation by the Lord
Chancellor, who justified his action, &ldquo;the subject
dropped.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>April
23rd.&mdash;Contains the following report as to</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE ELECTION.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The greatest activity prevails on both sides, and as the
decisive day approaches, the feelings of partizanship are
becoming greatly intensified.&nbsp; The printers have had a
lively time of it, and turn out a great quantity of matter, an
opinion appearing to be prevalent that quality is a secondary
consideration.&nbsp; During the last few days, songs, parodies
upon songs, speeches, and gross personal abuse have been issued
by the supporters of Mr. Watkin, (for it must be admitted that
Mr. Young holds himself aloof from this scurrility) with the
object, we suppose, of doing that gentleman some good.&nbsp; In
our opinion they will have a contrary effect, as we have heard
many respectable Liberal electors express themselves disgusted
with such unnecessary vulgarity.&nbsp; It may be very true, that
in addressing the people, it is necessary to call a spade a
spade, but it cannot be at all requisite that the minds of the
people should be attempted to be influenced by strong specimens
of the Billingsgate vocabulary.&nbsp; Where wit is lacking,
silence is preferable to blackguardism.&nbsp; On the Conservative
side there has also been a fair number of coloured bills and
printed addresses issued; but the writers in this interest have
abstained from attempting to be funny.&nbsp; In printed abuse,
however, they endeavour to rival their opponents.&nbsp; Betting,
if that may be considered a piece of electioneering business, is
decidedly in favour of the Conservative candidates.&nbsp; Each
party attributes motives of the most improper kind to the other,
and it will be seen that Mr. Watkin fears that his opponents may
indulge in &ldquo;corruption.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, Sir
E. Lacon says voters had told him they dare not support him, as
they should be inclined to do, in consequence of persons on the
Liberal side having put the &ldquo;screw&rdquo; upon them.&nbsp;
Tradesmen generally will be glad when the contest is over, as it

class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE NOMINATION&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>took place on the Hall Plain; the platform, in the centre of
which was reserved a place for the Mayor and the Candidates and
friends, being on the Crown and Anchor &ldquo;leads.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Blues were to the left of the Mayor and the Reds to his
right; and in front of the house there was at the time
proceedings commenced an assemblage numbering 4,000 or 5,000,
including a number of females.&nbsp; The Liberals were the first
to arrive on the &ldquo;leads,&rdquo; and on Mr. Watkin showing
himself to the crowd, he was loudly cheered, a compliment which
the candidate duly acknowledged.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards the
approach of the Conservative party was indicated by the deep
groans of the crowd, who manifested some indications of
hostility: but on its being discovered that the Conservative
cavalcade was headed by a party of very pugilistic-looking
persons, decorated with red ribbon, the threatening attitude of
the crowd was somewhat modified, and the two Baronets, with their
friends, were allowed to ascend to the &ldquo;leads&rdquo;
unmolested.&nbsp; When the two parties had taken their places on
the balcony, the Liberals proposed three cheers, which were given
by the great majority, accompanied by the groans of the
minority.&nbsp; A number of &ldquo;beery&rdquo; individuals
struggled to the front, and were a source of annoyance to the
speakers throughout.&nbsp; A few minutes before three
o&rsquo;clock the Mayor arrived in state, preceded by his
sergeants-at-mace, and accompanied in his carriage by Mr. C. J.
Palmer, who acted as his solicitor for the occasion.&nbsp; When
his Worship appeared in the balcony the Blues, for some reason,
commenced hissing him, much to the disgust of several of the
leading gentlemen of the Liberal party, who protested against
such unseemly proceedings.&nbsp; We may state, before attempting
to report the numerous speeches that were delivered, that during
the whole of the proceedings&mdash;more especially when it was
the turn of the Conservatives to speak&mdash;the crowd was
exceedingly disorderly, and by their loud shouting and groaning
rendered most of the speakers inaudable to persons a few yards
distant from them.&nbsp; The Mayor was grossly insulted at the
commencement, and as the proceedings progressed several fights
were got up, and the interference of the police was frequently
required.&nbsp; Anything more unreasonable and unreasoning than
the majority of the crowd it would be impossible to conceive, and
when the nomination closed there did not seem to be any person in
the balcony opposed to the opinion of the Mayor&mdash;that the
&ldquo;whole thing was a farce.&rdquo;&nbsp; One side of the
question was not heard at all, and the majority shouted without
knowing what about.&nbsp; This was singularly illustrated <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>during the
speech of Mr. Watkin, when that gentleman took upon himself the
functions of the returning-officer, by calling upon the crowd for
a show of hands, which, singularly enough, was against him.&nbsp;
Mr. Watkin said, &ldquo;All those that don&rsquo;t want me to go
to the poll, hold up their hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; A forest of hands
was exhibited to the great amusement of the Conservatives, who
cheered the result.&nbsp; Mr. Watkin then told his friends that
they were mistaken, and having explained the mistake to them,
assuring them that they were too intelligent to vote him down, he
took another show of hands, which was in his favour.&nbsp; We
shall be excused for commenting upon the proceedings here; but
the disorder and noise was so great that, as most of the speakers
could not be heard, we are necessitated to do it, in order to
make our report intelligible.&nbsp; From the beginning to the end
&ldquo;noise&rdquo; had it in numbers; but in fighting the honour
seemed to be with the Reds, who exhibited considerable
proficiency in the pugilistic art.&nbsp; The crowd, which was
very closely packed, was divided into two sections, the Blue and
the Red, the former having about ten to one of the latter.&nbsp;
At times both sections were very ill-behaved, but their
misconduct was kindly overlooked by the whole of the speakers
except Mr. Watkin, who took the liberty of designating the
minority of the &ldquo;people&rdquo; as &ldquo;scoundrels&rdquo;
and &ldquo;ruffians.&rdquo;&nbsp; These polite designations
appeared likely to stir up the ill-blood of the people, inasmuch
as four or five fights immediately commenced, in one of which an
unfortunate fellow sustained a severe fracture of the proboscis,
and it was not until the Mayor had, to use a significant local
word, &ldquo;checked&rdquo; Mr. Watkin, and warned him against
the violent nature of his harangue, that comparative order was
restored.&nbsp; The fights in question are deserving of
notice.&nbsp; One began between a female, whose bonnet was
trimmed with yellow ribbon, and a stout man in a blue
guernsey.&nbsp; Gallant Reds and Blues rushed into the affray,
doubtless with the object of protecting the woman, and there was
every probability of a general set-to.&nbsp; The Mayor, however,
directed the police to interfere, and the contest was suppressed,
with apparently no worse results than the infliction of a few
disagreeable blows on the frontispieces of the combatants.&nbsp;
The other fights were of less importance; but altogether this
display of pugnacity had the effect of causing the outside
portion of the crowd to run away from what they considered to be
danger.&nbsp; Other fights, as will be seen from the report, also
occurred.&nbsp; One feature in the general noise was much
remarked by the gentlemen on the balcony, and as it was amusing
we notice it.&nbsp; A half drunken beachman or fisherman, just so
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>far gone
as to be witty, but who was unmistakeably a Blue, planted himself
in front of the balcony, and by his extraordinary shouting
succeeded in making himself heard above the surrounding
tumult.&nbsp; There was some natural humour about this fellow,
and the way in which he shouted excited the laughter of the Mayor
and both parties on the balcony.&nbsp; The man shouted until the
veins grew large in his forehead; he jumped and screamed&mdash;he
laughed and waved his hat, and others laughed with
him&mdash;indeed, for a time all laughed with him; he was in a
state of ecstacy or violent enthusiasm.&nbsp; It was difficult
for a time to make out what the man meant, but at length he was
understood, and his fun was appreciated.&nbsp; Sir E. Lacon wears
a full moustache, and so does Sir H. Stracey, and those hirsute
ornaments were the objects of this excited individual&rsquo;s
enthusiasm.&nbsp; He laughed and shouted&mdash;his voice being
heard above the murmur of the crowd,&mdash;for fully an
hour,&mdash;&ldquo;The beard! the beard! will nobody shave
him?&nbsp; A shave! a shave!&nbsp; Fetch a barber! fetch a
barber!&mdash;(Loud laughter.)&mdash;A clean shave!&nbsp; A
shilling for a razor! a razor! a razor!&nbsp; O Lord, a clean
shave,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Ultimately the man climbed to the top
of a post, and threw his hat into the face of a railway porter;
the porter ran to him and struck him in the mouth two or three
times, with a force that evidently astonished him, and as his
scream then became somewhat distressing, he was ignominiously
removed to the outside of the crowd.&nbsp; Many other noticeable
incidents occurred, which will be found mentioned in our
report.&nbsp; But there is one circumstance which did not
altogether develop itself at the meeting, that we feel compelled
to notice.&nbsp; Society, from experience, knows that the prude
is the loudest and severest advocate of virtue; but, as Josephus
has remarked, &ldquo;Every man will think of this as it seemeth
good unto him.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have noticed the Gorleston voters,
we have recorded the boastings and professions on both sides, and
we have ventilated rumours which have been so far well
founded.&nbsp; The incident we are about to mention we can vouch
for; it is possible, should circumstances necessitate it, of
being proved.&nbsp; On the Wednesday evening, mob law,
intimidation, corruption, &ldquo;the screw,&rdquo; and all the
worst elements of electioneering were resorted to; and we regret
to say that the parties who most publicly exhibited themselves as
disorderlies were persons whom we won&rsquo;t classify, but who
cried out, &ldquo;Down with Lacon and Stracey&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Three cheers for Watkin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE
TIN CANISTER.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>A report had been &ldquo;current that a mysterious old
gentleman had <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>arrived from somewhere with a tin canister full of
sovereigns, and from the way in which he was dressed it was
generally supposed that he was either a Russian or a Shrewsbury
man come for the purpose of bribery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Said
person,&rdquo; as the Yankees say, was seen in the rear of the
balcony at the Crown and Anchor, defying anybody to penetrate the
secret of his identity, but occasionally winking and ejaculating,
with an occasionally eructory sound, the words, &ldquo;All
right&mdash;in for Watkin.&rdquo;&nbsp; This strange gentleman
departed in the evening, minus, it is said, the canister.&nbsp;
We will now pass over the irregularities of the story, and give
you the words of our informant, whose high standing and character
place him beyond suspicion:&mdash;&ldquo;I had attended the
Yarmouth nomination, and took my railway seat, at 8.40 p.m. for
Norwich.&nbsp; There were two or three gentlemen in the
first-class compartment in which I had placed myself; and one
gentleman was a peculiar sort of mysterious individual.&nbsp;
After eyeing the party well, the gentleman gravely said,
&ldquo;Both sides are buying, I&rsquo;m afraid, at
Yarmouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the party doubted the assertion,
but the ancient traveller smiled and said, &ldquo;No,
no.&rdquo;&nbsp; Further explanations took place, until at length
our interesting fellow-traveller volunteered this remark, after a
feeler from one of the party, &ldquo;You know I came down from
Manchester yesterday, to see my particular friend W&mdash;.&nbsp;
Deuced clever fellow&mdash;one of the best railway men in the
country.&nbsp; He did wonders for the Manchester and Lincolnshire
line, and if we get him in we shall expect him to be one of the
best railway men we have.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the party asked,
&ldquo;Are you a Yarmouth voter, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; Old Traveller:
&ldquo;No, but I wished to see my friend W&mdash; on very
particular business, and so I just came down to Yarmouth to see
how his election was getting on <i>as well</i>, and to add my
mite of influence.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, perhaps, will account for
the story of the tin canister.&nbsp; The rest we shall leave to
the report.&rdquo;</p>

H. K. Lacon.</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;MEETING TO ESTABLISH A VOLUNTEER RIFLE
CORPS.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>On Friday, a meeting, called by the Mayor, was held at the
Town Hall, to take into consideration certain communications
which his worship had received from General Peel, the Secretary
at War, and Lord Leicester, the Lord Lieutenant of the
County.&nbsp; There was a very numerous attendance.&nbsp; Amongst
the gentlemen present were&mdash;Sir E. Lacon, Bart., M.P.,
Lieutenant Colonel Beckham, Captain Naylor, Captain Holmes, Rev.
J. B. Bampton, Rev. T. Lowe, Messrs. J. H. Orde, F. Worship, W.
Worship, W. Yetts, S. C. Marsh, C. C. Aldred, C. J. Palmer, E. H.
L. Preston, J. Clowes, Foreman, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Mayor stated that he had called the meeting in consequence
of communications he had received from General Peel and the Lord
Lieutenant, and in compliance with a requisition which he had
received, and which was signed by seventy gentlemen.&nbsp; He
read General Peel&rsquo;s letter and the requisition.&nbsp; He
had prepared no resolution or anything of that sort, but should
leave the gentlemen assembled to propose anything they might
think proper.</p>
<p>Mr. W. Worship said the subject upon which they had been
called together was one upon which there could be no difference
of opinion&mdash;(hear, hear)&mdash;and in order to put the
proceedings into a practical form, he should move that a
committee be appointed, which would include Sir E. Lacon and Mr.
Orde.</p>
<p>Mr. R. Ferrier said he had much pleasure in seconding the
motion, and he hoped it would be understood that, although they
were forming a military corps, such men as himself might be
allowed to contribute to the expenses which would be incurred in
its formation.&nbsp; There were, doubtless, many men in the town
who could afford to pay for the accoutrements and give up the
necessary time; but there was also in the town a fine class of
men, in every way eligible, who could not afford that.&nbsp; It
was, therefore, in assisting the latter class that such men as
himself could be useful.&nbsp; (Hear, hear.)&nbsp; He should be
glad himself to pay the annual expenses of some man who could not
afford to do it himself; and had no objection to put his name
down at once for &pound;10 a year.&nbsp; (Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>Mr. S. C. Marsh said he did not wish to interrupt the
proceedings; but before they formed the committee he thought they
should, by some resolution, declare it desirable to form a Rifle
Corps.&nbsp; (Hear, hear.)&nbsp; Having decided to form a corps,
the next step would be to form a committee <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>to carry
out the necessary arrangements.&nbsp; He was sure Englishmen
would respond to the offer that had been made them to allow
themselves to form volunteer corps for the defence of the
country.&nbsp; Norfolk had never been behindhand in the
manifestation of patriotic feeling, and he hoped that would not
be the case on this occasion.&nbsp; Yarmouth had before shown
what she could do for the Governments of England and the defence
of the country, and he hoped she was prepared to do something
now.&nbsp; (Hear, hear.)&nbsp; He begged to move &ldquo;That it
is expedient to establish a Volunteer Rifle Corps for Great
Yarmouth and its vicinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ferrier seconded.&mdash;Carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Sir E. Lacon, M.P. said he thought it highly essential that a
town like Yarmouth should take a stand and come forward at once
in obedience to the proclamation that had been issued by the
Queen.&nbsp; They must all put their shoulders to the wheel, and
wherever they saw a fine young fellow who was a likely man for
the corps, if he did not come forward they must ask him to do
so.&nbsp; The duty they had to do that day was very slight
indeed, but for his own part, he would say that he should give
the movement all the encouragement that he possibly could.&nbsp;
(Hear, hear.)&nbsp; He should now move that a committee be
appointed, with power to appoint a sub-committee, and with
directions to go round the town and see what force could be got
up.&nbsp; (Hear, hear.)&nbsp; Yarmouth was a large town it was
true, but there were also districts around it out of which to
draw much assistance; but he certainly thought it would be
desirable to take in the Flegg Hundreds and the Island.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Clowes said there were many men in the town who, from
age and other causes, would be unable to serve in a rifle corps,
but who would be very desirous of taking part in the defence of
our shores&mdash;men who were too old to sleep all night in the
marsh ditches, or under hedges.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; For that
class of men, he thought there should be an Artillery Corps, as
many of them, though not fit to take the field, would be ready to
man a gun or work a battery.</p>
<p>The Mayor said it was out of the scope of the present meeting
to discuss an Artillery Corps.</p>
<p>Mr. Orde said Government had intended that they would sanction
and approve the formation of Artillery Corps.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh&rsquo;s motion was then put and carried.</p>
<p>Sir E. Lacon, in answer to Dr. Stephenson, said it would, no
doubt, be a desirable thing to have a mounted Rifle Corps, only
they could not get the horses, and if they could get them, many
would be unable to <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>keep them, besides which he should object, unless he
wished to see some of them killed, to their mounting
horses.&nbsp; (Loud laughter.)&nbsp; But he might say that, at an
agricultural dinner, where he was the other day, he heard the
farmers express themselves strongly in favour of a mounted force
in the Fleggs and the Island.</p>
<p>Mr. C. J. Palmer suggested that all who wished to support the
corps, either by serving in it or by their subscriptions, should
come forward and put down their names at once.&nbsp; (Hear,
hear.)</p>
<p>The Mayor said he would take down the names of any gentlemen
who wished to join the corps.&nbsp; When they saw who were
willing to join, they might name a committee, and appoint some
gentleman to act as secretary.&nbsp; That being done, the future
conduct of the movement would remain with the committee.</p>
<p>The following gentlemen then gave in their names as members of
the corps:&mdash;Sir E. H. K. Lacon, M.P., Sir H. Stracey, M.P.,
Lieutenant-Colonel Beckham, S. C. Marsh, C. J. Palmer, B. Jay, R.
Ferrier, W. Worship, F. Palmer, F. Worship, W. J. Foreman, W. C.
Reynolds, S. Aldred, Dr. Stephenson, J. H. Orde, G. Harvey, G.
Baker, Rev. J. B. Bampton, H. Teasdel, J. W. Bunn, Captain
Holmes, C. Brown, J. Tomlinson, H. R. Harmer, G. Diver, H. H.
Barber, J. Franklin, E. Fyson, J. B. Stevens, J. Playford, G. B.
Costerton, H. Teasdel, T. P. Burroughs, Ambrose Palmer, A. W.
Morant, Rev. T. Lowe, and J. Clowes.</p>
<p>Mr. R. Ferrier moved that the foregoing be appointed a
committee to carry out the arrangements for establishing the
corps, with power to appoint a sub-committee; and that Colonel
Beckham be requested to act as honorary secretary.</p>
<p>The motion was carried unanimously, and the book containing
the list of names was ordered to be left at the Police-station
during the ensuing week, to give persons desirous of joining the
corps an opportunity of entering their names.</p>
<p>The proceedings then concluded.</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VISIT OF THE CHANNEL FLEET.</span></p>
<p>The Channel Fleet has at length visited our Roads, much to the
gratification of thousands of the Queen&rsquo;s lieges, as well
as to the galling disappointment of thousands of the same
excellent body.&nbsp; The squadron came in in the open day, clear
to the gaze of multitudes, but disappeared like a majestic
phantom in the night.&nbsp; A little more than a week ago we were
informed that the Channel Fleet had, after an anchorage of
sixteen days in St. Margaret&rsquo;s Hope, Frith of Forth, left
its moorings under canvas, with auxiliary steam power, and
proceeded down the Frith and out to sea, destined for the
Yarmouth Roads.&nbsp; As we stated in our last impression, the
consequence of that information being diffused was to put all the
speculators and quidnuncs of the town and neighbourhood on the
alert.&nbsp; Leaving St. Margaret&rsquo;s Hope on the Saturday,
the fleet would certainly, it was argued, be here on the Tuesday,
on which day the Marine Parade and the Beach were literally
swarmed with expectant people, whose glasses were searching the
waters in every direction; but, owing either to the perversity of
Admiral Neptune, the weather office, or the Vice-Admiral in
command (who is admitted by everyone to be a pleasant and
courteous gentleman), the fleet did not arrive.&nbsp; Much
disappointment and innumerable prophecies followed, and while
some knowing individuals averred positively, and &ldquo;on
undoubted authority&rdquo; that the fleet had passed and would
not come in here, others were equally confident, on the strength
of telegrams and &ldquo;unquestionable information,&rdquo; that
the great ships would be seen, on the &ldquo;next
flood.&rdquo;&nbsp; As, however, they put in no appearance up to
Friday evening, the conviction that they had omitted us began to
be pretty general, especially when &ldquo;undoubted
authority&rdquo; satisfied us that the squadron had been seen
some distance to the south of this port, namely, in the
Wold.&nbsp; A few persons held out, notwithstanding their belief
that the ships would visit us, and were stirring early on
Saturday morning to catch the latest intelligence, when lo! the
rumour spread that the fleet was in sight.&nbsp; People began
hurrying to the Beach, which, between 8 and 10 o&rsquo;clock a.m.
presented, as to throng and bustle, an appearance equal to that
of <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>Tuesday, with the single exception that the fair sex
had not had time to put on the gay attire in which they looked so
well on that day.&nbsp; As the Royal Albert, three decker, flag
ship of Vice-Admiral Freemantle, came in sight, the cry was,
&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; and as the magnificent vessel
steamed up into the gat there appeared something so triumphant
and majestic in her appearance as to make every one who saw her
feel proud of the &ldquo;wooden walls,&rdquo; which have so long
defied all the enemies of Old England.&nbsp; Britannia from the
top of the lofty pedestal in front of the gatway might look down
with pride upon the splendid ship which marched in stately
grandeur &ldquo;o&rsquo;er the mountain waves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Royal Albert was seen to be followed by a long dark line of
smoke, and every few minutes other great ships came in sight
moving apparently with ease and controllable but irresistible
force.&nbsp; As the flagship came through the gat of St.
Nicholas, the dense masses of people who lined the shore
expressed in a variety of forms their admiration of the
dimensions and commanding aspect of this great three
decker.&nbsp; The seafaring people looked at the matter with a
professional eye, and amongst them might frequently be heard such
expressions as &ldquo;Old Rounce (the Gorleston pilot) is
bringing her in stunnin!&rdquo;&nbsp; On came the great
ship,&mdash;as gracefully and as gently as a swan would move upon
the surface of an untroubled lake,&mdash;until she was
surprisingly near the shore for a ship of her size.&nbsp; She
then glided round in a most beautiful manner, as if looking for
the best place to drop her anchor, a point which was soon
decided, when it was found that she was in about an exact line
with the Victoria Hotel.&nbsp; The sight in the gatway had now
become grand in the extreme, as all the line of battle ships were
in sight, moving majestically forward by the aid of power unseen,
while the flagship was actively engaged in signalling to the
various ships as they came up as to the respective positions they
were to take.&nbsp; The ships seemed to be managed with perfect
ease, and could be turned or moved in any direction with
surprising celerity.&nbsp; The scene while they were taking up
their positions and dropping their anchors was beautiful and will
not soon be forgotten by those who saw it.</p>
<p>The Locust, steam tender, had arrived in the Roads previously,
and the ships that arrived with the Royal Albert, which has 121
guns, and carries 1,100 men, were the Edgar, 91, flagship of the
Rear-Admiral Erskine, the Mersey frigate, 40; the Donegal, 101;
the Trafalgar, 91; the Conqueror, the Centurion, the Mars, the
Diadem, the Algiers, the Aboukir, and the Greyhound corvette, 17,
acting as tender to the Royal <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>Albert.&nbsp; The fleet anchored in
two lines, and presented a most gratifying spectacle to the
inhabitants, who felt what a security it must be in a time of
war, while at the same time they could not refrain from
reflecting on the terrible havoc that must be committed were
those quiet-looking ships to unbosom their thunders, and vent
their indignation upon the town for a space of about five
minutes.&nbsp; Soon after the Vice-Admiral&rsquo;s flag ship had
anchored, the Volunteer Artillery fired a salute of 15 guns, but
owing to the regulations of the service, the ship was precluded
from returning the compliment.&nbsp; The band of the Artillery
subsequently played on the Drive, and gave a festive character to
the morning.&nbsp; Reports rapidly got afloat as to how long the
fleet would stay, some contending that it would not go till
Wednesday, as the Admiral and officers had accepted an invitation
to a ball which the Mayor purposed giving at the Town Hall on
Tuesday evening; while, on the other hand, it was asserted that
the fleet would depart in the course of the night, as during the
day they received five or six despatches from the Admiralty, and
thus disappoint the thousands who it was expected would come into
the town by rail on Sunday.&nbsp; Neither of the predictions
turned out to be true.&nbsp; Had the ships not been detained at
sea by the contrary winds, which caused them to keep steam up
even to the last, they would have been here for four or five
days.&nbsp; Before coming in they had for two or three days been
within 60 miles of us, trying to reach here with their sails
alone.&nbsp; They had not been long at anchor before sundry
mariners and bare-footed frolicsome and reckless tars, were seen
ashore, lugging away immense baskets of fresh bread, butter,
&amp;c., and diversifying this duty by fraternising with as many
of the girlhood of the place as they happened to come in contact
with.&nbsp; The Blue Jackets are decided favourites ashore, and
few people seem disposed to prevent them doing as they
please.&nbsp; It would give great satisfaction to the inhabitants
of this town, if, in their annual cruises, the Channel Squadron
would occasionally drop in here, for we are sure that their
present visit, besides being advantageous to the town, will
obtain many seamen; for who would wander about in a rotten and
miserable old collier when he might lead a worthy and a jolly
life amongst excellent fellows, on board a floating tower and
mansion equal to the most convenient and best regulated
establishments ashore?&nbsp; It is a long time since a fleet was
seen in our Roads, although there is probably no point upon the
coast where so much shipping passes as this.&nbsp; The last fleet
that was in the Roads was in 1810, under the command of Admiral
Somers, whose flagship was the Victory <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>(Nelson&rsquo;s old ship), and that fleet passed here
on its way to the Baltic, the ports of which it was going to
blockade.&nbsp; There were then in the fleet besides the
Admiral&rsquo;s ship of 98 guns, the Formidable, 98; the St.
George, 98; the Dreadnought, 98, now a hospital ship, and a
number of 74&rsquo;s, making together fourteen sail, some of
which were with Admiral Sir John Ross, at the blockade of
Dantzic, in 1812 (and frozen up there in 1813).&nbsp; In 1801,
Nelson was in here on his way to Copenhagen, and in 1807, Admiral
Gambier&rsquo;s fleet was bound for the same place, and sailing
hence fetched in the ships and stores of the Danes.&nbsp; In the
time of those fleets, the North Sea and Baltic Pilots of this
port were of great service&mdash;a class of men of whom, we
believe, only one remains.&nbsp; His name is Richard Webb.&nbsp;
He was frozen up in the Baltic in 1812, while acting as pilot
(wintered there during the burning of Moscow), and was altogether
engaged for 15 years in piloting government vessels in the wars
of that time, important services for which the old boy alleges he
has received nothing but unfulfilled promises from the
&ldquo;great guns&rdquo; aloft.&nbsp; One would think that an old
sailor who had served in the &ldquo;battle and the breeze&rdquo;
for so long a period, and in such momentous times, ought to have
received some substantial recognition of his services.</p>
<p>The fleet and the officers and men from it who came ashore
during the day have been closely scrutinized and gazed at,
parties having been on board the flagship, it became a question
of interest as to what they would do at night.&nbsp; At sunset a
gun was fired from the Admiral&rsquo;s ship, at the sound of
which, as if by magic, the flags dropped from the stern of every
vessel at the same instant, though the topyards did not go down
as was expected.&nbsp; That was about half-past eight
o&rsquo;clock, and at nine bang went another gun from the
Admiral&rsquo;s ship followed by the rattle of musketry on board
the others, and seamen said, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the old Admiral
a-fallen down the main hatchway,&rsquo; that being the correct
nautical form of indicating that the hands were ordered to
&lsquo;turn in.&rsquo;&nbsp; At about the same time lights were
shown in front and at the sterns of the ships, producing a
brilliant and lively spectacle, taken in conjunction with the
hundreds of lights on small craft lying at anchor, and as shown
by the screw colliers which were ever and anon passing through
the fleet and flowing out dark volumes of smoke.&nbsp; With
Saturday Mr. Swann&rsquo;s contract to supply beef at 4&frac12;d.
per lb., luckily for him, expired, and he agreed, we believe, to
execute the orders of the fleet at 6&frac12;d.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, as had been anticipated by the Yarmouth
innkeepers and others, brought an immense number of people into
the town, the <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>trains from Norwich being very lengthy.&nbsp; The
weather was fine, and as the fleet still remained in the Roads,
there was every prospect of enjoyment.&nbsp; As the excursionists
came into the town they proceeded, after refreshing the inner man
at the earliest opportunity, either to the beach or on board the
three steamers of Fill and Co. (Chesapeake, Volunteer and
Florence Nightingale), which were ready, as soon as filled, to
start for a journey round the fleet.&nbsp; The Chesapeake was the
first to start, and as she steamed down the harbour the
excursionists had a good view of the quays and shipping, and also
of the hamlet of Gorleston.&nbsp; As soon as the bar was crossed,
the great ships were all plainly visible, their sides bristling
with guns, and alive with seamen, who, on the visitors
approaching, exchanged a few friendly shouts with them.&nbsp;
From the middle of the two lines in which they were moored, the
ships had a noble and awe-inspiring effect upon those who had not
before seen such wonders of the sea&mdash;they were, in fact, so
many towers of strength filled with dauntless warriors.&nbsp; The
Mersey, the smartest, the swiftest, and most powerful frigate of
the fleet, was greatly admired, as was also the Royal Albert, and
many thought&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How proud must be our Admiral<br />
Of such a bonny barque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officers and men were at nearly all parts of the ship, and
cordially invited the excursionists to go on board, an offer
which the steamer declined, out of regard to the safety of the
passengers.&nbsp; Small pleasure boats from the beach, however,
were running to the fleet in large numbers, cutting and plunging
through the sea that might have made some persons timid.&nbsp;
The steamers disembarked their freight at the Britannia Pier
(which found Sunday the most prosperous day of its existence) and
continued throughout the day to run to and from that Pier without
intermission.&nbsp; Indeed, in the afternoon the Britannia Pier,
which was crowded almost from end to end, presented a remarkable
spectacle.&nbsp; The beef, potatoes, and greens for the fleet
were brought to the pier-head in carts, and were stacked for
conveyance to the ships in the ships&rsquo; boats.&nbsp; The
sailors, amongst whom was the usual per centage of black fellows,
tossed the beef and cabbages into the boats in a manner not at
all ceremonious, and one quarter to a certainty, though some say
three or four, was pitched into Davey Jones&rsquo;s locker.&nbsp;
This scene of conveying away the carcases of about 60 bullocks
(so the number was stated, though we think over the mark), of a
few sheep, and goodness only knows how many cabbages and loaves,
was very interesting to the public, and kept the pier <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>crowded
with spectators till six or seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There was
in the afternoon and evening the largest assemblage of people on
the parade and beach that the oldest inhabitant remembers to have
seen in the town, and it was not till a late hour that the last
disappeared.&nbsp; The effect of so many strangers being in the
town was to effect an entire demolition of most of the eatable
stores in the hands of the innkeepers; and it is sufficient to
say that a great thirst prevailed.&nbsp; The Jacks and officers
who were ashore in some force in the afternoon preferred
wandering into the town and outskirts; and the former, who as a
rule were shoeless, seemed to pick up a good deal of fun.&nbsp;
Besides the usual mode of conveyance of pouring in visitors, we
observed several original vehicles from the country arrive in the
afternoon, laden to excess and to the evident inconvenience of
the passengers.&nbsp; The day passed off so well that the
majority of the inhabitants retired, hoping, we have no doubt,
that the Channel Fleet might remain a week.&nbsp; Sinister
rumours, however, were at work, and some fears were secretly
entertained.&nbsp; Great bags of letters had been taken from and
sent to the Post Office, and report was that despatches had been
received ordering the fleet off to Spithead at once.</p>
<p>When the general bulk of the population awoke on Monday
morning, alas! the fleet&mdash;with the exception of the Mars,
which had lost an anchor and was waiting to endeavour to regain
it&mdash;were off!&nbsp; They left us between five and six
o&rsquo;clock; and many have a firm opinion that the Mars was
detained by some Providential influence, so that the thousands of
excursionists who came in on Monday, in the hope of seeing the
Channel Fleet, might not be utterly disappointed.&nbsp; May a
British Fleet honour us again with its presence, at the earliest
opportunity.</p>

Yarmouth,<br />
&ldquo;Nov. 29th, 1860.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;Upon full enquiry, I find that the
statements made by me in a speech at the dinner at the Theatre in
April last, and complained of by you as reflecting on yourself as
a member of the committee therein referred to, were made under an
erroneous impression of the facts of the case, as far as yourself
and the committee are concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under these circumstances, I have no hesitation in
withdrawing the imputations you and the committee complain of,
and the plea of justification, and in expressing my regret that
legal proceedings were deemed necessary, which, being now ended,
no difference will, I trust, henceforth be made in the friendly
feeling that has previously existed between us.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours truly,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Edm. H. K. Lacon</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following account is given of this:&mdash;&ldquo;With the
exception of two or three of the candidates who came forward as
Liberals, the aspirants for Municipal honours did not this year
favour the public with any printed expositions of their views, or
any explanations of the grounds upon which they came
forward.&nbsp; The elections of Friday, however did not cause
much excitement, although at the eleventh hour the Conservatives
found themselves opposed in all the wards except St.
Andrew&rsquo;s, in which Messrs. W. T. Clarke, and R. Steward
were elected unopposed.&nbsp; In the Market Ward, Mr. Gourlay (L)
and Mr. E. Aldred (C) sought re-election, and the new candidate
was Mr. Lawn, Liberal.&nbsp; The result of the voting
was&mdash;Gourlay, 60; Aldred, 59; Lawn, 20.&nbsp; The two
former, of course, were elected.&nbsp; In the Regent Ward, Mr.
Barber, Conservative, sought re-election, and in the place of Mr.
Norman, surgeon (C), who retired, Dr. Stephenson (C) was put
forward.&nbsp; The candidates on the other side were Messrs.
Livingston and de Caux.&nbsp; The ward again showed its
partiality for medicine, and polled as follows:&mdash;Barber,
109; Stephenson, 106; Livingston, 81; de Caux, 69.&mdash;In St.
George&rsquo;s Ward, the Conservative candidates, who sought

<p>May 17th.&mdash;The following appears as to the Corporate
Robes of Office:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE ROBES OF OFFICE.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The Committee as to the Wearing of Robes of Office reported
that Mr. C. J. Palmer, had liberally presented to the Council a
scarlet silk gown, and a black gown formerly worn by the Mayors
as their Robes of Office; and the said were accepted by the
Committee, and the thanks of the Committee were voted to Mr.
Palmer for the <i>handsome</i> donation.&nbsp; The Committee had
resolved that the Mayor should wear the black gown as a Robe of
Office on all &ldquo;Ordinary&rdquo; occasions and the scarlet
gown on all &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; occasions.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Robes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gown&rdquo; movement, which
was so much spoken of six months ago, has at length&mdash;through
the exertions of the Committee to whom it was referred&mdash;come
to maturity, and the Mayor now has a second hand best gown for
&ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; occasions, and a second-hand second
best gown for &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; occasions.&nbsp; The old
people about Gaol Street, who caught a sight of the Mayor in his
gown on Tuesday last, look upon the revived <i>costume</i> as a
&ldquo;degenerate resurrection;&rdquo; for, instead of there
being completeness and congruity in the &ldquo;fit out,&rdquo;
there is a burlesque mixture of the ancient and modern.&nbsp; The
gown which erst harmonised with the glorious cocked hat, short
tights, and silver buckled shoes, appears decidedly &ldquo;at
sea&rdquo; in company with the modern hat (or <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>&ldquo;4s.
and 9d.&rdquo;) and &ldquo;peg-top&rdquo; trousers.&nbsp; Art
critics would object to so close a mixture of the medi&aelig;val
and the modern, on the ground of the same not being &ldquo;in
keeping.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps, however, when we see the style of
dress on one of the &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; occasions so
judiciously and so elaborately provided for by the Council, we
may have something presented to notice which will not cause every
Councillor to grin on beholding it, and to talk, as an old writer
says, &ldquo;most consumedly&rdquo; about it afterwards.&nbsp;
Dressed as he was on Tuesday, the Mayor of Yarmouth might,
without difficulty, have been mistaken (had he been away from
home) for Shylock, for one of the Japanese Embassy, or for an
Arch Druid, so remarkably unusual was his appearance.&nbsp;
Experience may, it is true, tone down the angularities of the
affair; but at the onset the revival of the use of robes does not
carry with it either the appearance of gravity or wisdom.&nbsp;
On entering the Council Room on Tuesday, the Mayor was preceded
by four officials wearing, in addition to the ordinary attire of
various colours, gowns, and carrying the sword and two maces as
usual, with, on this occasion, the very handsome oar&mdash;a part
of the regalia which had, for some very
&ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; reason no doubt, been disused.&nbsp;
Following the officers were the Mayor, who wore in addition to
his every day clothing a black robe, of somewhat fierce cut,
having a sort of fur or bear skin epulet at each shoulder,
ornamented with a description of rough filagree; and over this
finery his worship wore (we believe for the first time) the gold
chain of office.&nbsp; After the Mayor, entered the Town Clerk in
a black robe of a more modest character.&nbsp; For some little
time there was much winking and smiling amongst the Aldermen and
Councillors.&nbsp; The business then proceeded, and, as will be
seen from our report of the meeting, arrangements were made (in
spite of Mr. Richard Ferrier&rsquo;s &ldquo;chaffing&rdquo;) for
the order of processions.&nbsp; It was also decided to give the
Town Hall and the inhabitants the benefit of a public clock, of
which the Corporation are owners.&nbsp; It was also jocularly
suggested that the Gas Company would be most willing gratuitously
to illuminate the dial, and through it the inhabitants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May 21st.&mdash;There had been an &ldquo;Uproarious Vestry
Meeting,&rdquo; held for the object of passing a vote of censure
on the Vestry Clerk; Mr. S. C Marsh presided, and in the result,
the meeting being in favour of the Vestry Clerk, a poll was
demanded.</p>
<p>May 29th.&mdash;This poll had, after a protest by Mr. J.
Clowes as to the regularity of the proceedings, been taken by Mr.
C. Diver (acting as Assessor).&nbsp; It closed on the first
day&mdash;</p>

<p>June 4th.&mdash;This issue contains the following account
of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE CHANNEL FLEET AND PRINCE
ALFRED.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>For several days after Wednesday last, a number of persons in
this town were almost in a fever of expectation as to the arrival
of Prince Alfred, in the &ldquo;St. George;&rdquo; and in spite
of official intimation that the Prince is to be considered on
business when with the fleet, and, as a consequence, exempt from
municipal honours and popular demonstrations, it was determined
to make the most of him here.&nbsp; The forerunners of the
&ldquo;St. George&rdquo; were boarded and teased by all sorts of
enquiries; bills were posted about with the words &ldquo;the
arrival of Prince Alfred&rdquo; upon them, and all imaginable
measures taken to get up excitement.&nbsp; All, however, failed
to draw a large number of strangers to the town; and we do not
exceed the fact when we say that the visit of the Channel
Squadron for a much briefer period in 1860, brought to the town
ten times the number of strangers who have come on this
occasion.&nbsp; The Mayor of Yarmouth, soon after the fleet
arrived, offered to give the officers a dinner if they would
accept the invitation; but it was declined.&nbsp; A ball was then
offered to be got up, and it was promised that such of the
officers as could attend would do so if the ships still remained
in the Roads and provided it were got up for the earliest
possible day&mdash;Monday.&nbsp; A ball was, therefore, decided
on for that evening.&nbsp; But some uneasiness was felt as to the
non-arrival of the &ldquo;St. George&rdquo; with Prince Alfred;
and when, on Saturday, the ship did not appear, it began to be
feared that she would not come, and the people consoled
themselves with such information as that the Admiral&mdash;a
jolly tar&mdash;had amused himself by playing a game of bowls at
the Vauxhall Green, &amp;c.&nbsp; Although Admiral Smart and the
officers declined to dine with the Mayor on shore, they invited
his worship and other gentlemen to dine with them afloat, which
<a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>the
Mayor accepted for Saturday night.&nbsp; On Sunday morning the
&ldquo;St. George&rdquo; came quietly into the Roads through the
Cockle Gat, and anchored at the northern end of the line of
ships, abreast of the town, at about half-past eight
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It was reported for some time that the ship
which had just arrived was the &ldquo;Donegal,&rdquo; but as it
became known that it really was the &ldquo;St. George,&rdquo;
flags were run up in all directions, and persons went to work
with their spy glasses, apparently hoping to catch a sight of the
Prince.&nbsp; The steamtugs, which ran as passenger boats round
the fleet, at once got better freights, and many who took trips
in them returned under the impression that they had seen the
Prince in the maintop of the &ldquo;St. George.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Others would have it that the Prince was one of the young
officers who was ashore on Sunday afternoon, walking leisurely up
and down the drive and elsewhere; this turned out to be
correct.&nbsp; But as the Prince was, happily for him, not
recognised whilst ashore, he walked about unmolested.&nbsp; Few
persons believed that so large a ship as the &ldquo;St.
George&rdquo; (Captain Egerton) would venture to enter the Roads
through the Cockle, but to the surprise of many local nautical
authorities she sailed through as cleanly as any fishing cutter,
and dropped anchor in as familiar a manner as might have been
expected from an old visitant of these waters.&nbsp; Soon after
she had anchored the &ldquo;St. George&rdquo; was boarded by Mr.
Watson, secretary of the Sailors&rsquo; Home, who brought off
messages and letters.&nbsp; Prince Alfred went on shore,
<i>incognito</i>, in the afternoon, as did also a large number of
other midshipmen and older officers.&nbsp; On Monday morning, the
town authorities, and sightseers generally, were on the
alert&mdash;all being in search of the Prince.&nbsp; But again,
as few individuals had a personal knowledge of his Royal
Highness, he escaped without recognition, and with Major Cowell
(and, we believe, other gentlemen) he drove out into the
country.&nbsp; As to this and other proceedings of the Prince
during the day, there were scores of different reports; but we
believe we are correct in saying that, after his trip inland, His
Royal Highness went from the Beach, in the boat of which he is
midshipman, on board the &ldquo;St. George.&rdquo;&nbsp; On board
the ship the Mayor and Town Clerk were, we understand, introduced
to the Prince, and courteously received.&nbsp; Between two and
three o&rsquo;clock p.m., the Prince, Admiral Smart, Major
Cowell, and the Hon. Manners Sutton (with whom the Prince had
consented to partake of luncheon, at Kimberley Terrace), came on
shore, accompanied in the boat by the Mayor and Town Clerk.&nbsp;
His Royal Highness, the Hon. Manners Sutton, and Major Cowell,
then <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>walked down to the Cricket Ground at the South Denes,
where a party of officers from the fleet were playing a game of
cricket with the members of the Yarmouth Club.&nbsp; It had been
reported that the Prince would visit the Cricket Ground, and the
consequence was that a large number of persons (probably 2,000)
congregated there about two o&rsquo;clock, over and above those
individuals who had been previously attracted to the spot by the
match itself, and by the two bands&mdash;one from the fleet, and
that of the East Norfolk Militia.&nbsp; As soon as His Royal
Highness was recognised upon the ground, the crowd rapidly closed
in around him, and had it not been for the protection afforded
him by the two gentlemen by whom he was accompanied, he would in
all likelihood have undergone an unpleasant jostling.&nbsp; So
pressing and eager did the inquisitive public become that in a
few minutes the Royal sailor and Mr. Sutton commenced a
retrograde movement, whereupon the people began running and
pushing frantically&mdash;going in some instances as the saying
hath it, &ldquo;head over heels.&rdquo;&nbsp; Remarks such as
&ldquo;That is he!&rdquo; with comments upon the Prince&rsquo;s
personal appearance, were loud and frequent; and much surprise
appeared to be felt that the &ldquo;Duke of York&rdquo; should go
abroad in the ordinary unassuming attire of a midshipman.&nbsp;
Some faint attempts at cheering were assayed, but the clamour of
the &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; which was got up, overpowered everything
but the dust.&nbsp; The Prince took all this good humouredly, and
with his two protectors walked sharply on to Kimberley Terrace,
pursued all the way up the drive by an immense crowd.&nbsp; Most
of the persons going southward, and who met the crowd, had no
idea what all the row was about until they were told.&nbsp; His
Royal Highness got safely to Mr. Sutton&rsquo;s house, and in two
or three minutes there was in front of the house, close from the
area railing to the coping-stones of the drive on the eastward, a
dense assemblage, which continued to increase up to five
o&rsquo;clock, when we observed it still standing there.</p>
<p>Lunch over, the Prince, a little after five o&rsquo;clock,
escaped from the back door, unobserved by the crowd, and was
enabled to stroll into the town.&nbsp; He went up St.
George&rsquo;s Road, through King Street, down Regent Street, and
along the Quay, but did not venture into the Market Row.&nbsp; He
then visited Mrs. Onslow, who son is chaplain on board the
&ldquo;St. George,&rdquo; and, we believe, a tutor of the
Prince.</p>
<p>The cricket match terminated in favour of the naval men, who
had, we hear, 69 runs to spare.&nbsp; In the first innings the
Yarmouth players had the best of it, but in the second the
bowling of Midshipman Lawson made sad havoc among the
batsmen.</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>The
Ball at the Town Hall was well attended, and went off with great
<i>&eacute;clat</i>.&nbsp; The Prince, of course, was not
present; but in the course of the evening Admiral Smart and a
party of naval officers&mdash;who were brought up to the
Quay-side, opposite the Hall, in the &ldquo;Porpoise&rdquo;
gunboat&mdash;joined the assembly and remained until after
midnight.</p>
<p>The number of visitors to the ships increased considerably on
Tuesday (this) morning, when it became known that an order had
been received for the ships to hold themselves in readiness for
sailing next day.</p>
<p>Altogether the visit of the fleet on this occasion has been a
brilliant affair; and the public have had ample time to inspect
the ships, some of which might much oftener, with advantage, find
a berth in Yarmouth Roads.</p>
<p>The town has not, we believe, been visited by a Royal
personage since the time that Prince William (afterwards King)
and the Princess Adelaide landed here, and remained for the night
at the Angel Hotel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>June 7th.&mdash;At the Channel Fleet Ball among those present
were the Mayor, the Town Clerk, Sir E. Lacon, M.P., Admiral
Smart, Captain Fellowes, R.N., Captain Egerton, R.N., Lieutenant
the Hon. F. Gordon, Mr. and Miss I. Preston, Lord W. Kerr and
other naval officers, Mr. and Mrs. E. H. L. Preston, Mr. and Mrs.
C. C. Aldred, Misses Cubitt, Mr. A. and Misses Steward,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Next day a large number of persons visited the
fleet, and dancing took place on the ships&rsquo; decks.</p>
<p>Colonel Ibetson had inspected the Rifle Volunteers on the
Denes.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ino&rdquo; (a pleasure boat) had capsized when
alongside the &ldquo;St. George,&rdquo; but all the people in her
were saved.</p>
<p>June 11th.&mdash;At the Vestry Meeting, the &ldquo;Small
Tenements Act&rdquo; was proposed to be applied to the
parish.</p>
<p>Several houses and men had been struck by lightning during a
thunderstorm.</p>
<p>June 14th.&mdash;The programme for the Volunteer Review had
been published; it was expected that 3,324 men would take part in
it.</p>
<p>June 18th.&mdash;The Dinner to the Volunteers on this occasion
was to take place on St. George&rsquo;s Denes; there were to be
17 tables, and the dining room to cover 7,550 feet of
ground.&nbsp; One quart of beer per man had been offered by Sir
E. Lacon to the Volunteers.</p>
<p>June 21st.&mdash;The Review had taken place and proved a great
success: there were 3,324 men actually on the Denes.&nbsp; At the
Dinner held on St. George&rsquo;s Denes, the Mayor presided, and
after giving the toasts <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>of &ldquo;The Queen&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Royal Family,&rdquo; he gave &ldquo;The Army, Navy,
and Militia,&rdquo; to which Colonel Grey, C.B., Captain Lacon,
R.N., and Colonel Adair responded.&nbsp; The Mayor then gave
&ldquo;The Volunteers,&rdquo; to which Colonel Brett replied, and
&ldquo;The Lord Lieutenants of Norfolk and Suffolk,&rdquo; which
was acknowledged by Lord Suffield (Vice-Lieutenant of Norfolk)
and Colonel Adair.&nbsp; The Mayor then gave &ldquo;The High
Sheriff,&rdquo; who responded.&nbsp; The Mayor then gave
&ldquo;The Lord High Steward,&rdquo; responded to by Lord Sondes,
and &ldquo;The health of Colonel Grey,&rdquo; to which that
officer replied; also &ldquo;The Brigadiers of the Day,&rdquo;
replied to by Colonels Custance, Sir E. Lacon, and Astley.&nbsp;
The High Sheriff then proposed &ldquo;The Mayor,&rdquo; to which
his Worship responded, and the healths of the Rev. H. Nevill, of
the Noblemen and Gentlemen &ldquo;who had honoured us with their
presence,&rdquo; of &ldquo;Mr. Charles J. Palmer&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Ladies&rdquo; were also given and responded to.&nbsp;
It was considered that &ldquo;The Mayor and gentlemen who formed
the Committee of Management, and particularly Mr. Charles J.
Palmer, well deserved the thanks of the public and the
Volunteers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June 28th.&mdash;Major Marsh (of the artillery) had resigned
his commission.</p>
<p>July 2nd.&mdash;It was stated that Major Marsh would be
succeeded in his command by Capt. John Lee Barber of the 1st
Company, but Mr. Trafford was stated to have also resigned, and
it was rumoured that the Artillery was likely to be amalgamated
with the Rifle Corps.</p>
<p>July 9th.&mdash;The Midsummer herring voyage was a
failure.&nbsp; Some attributed this to the 130 smacks then
fishing from the port, and others to the early catches of
immature fish.</p>
<p>July 12th.&mdash;&ldquo;Blondin&rdquo; had been performing at
the Victoria Gardens.</p>
<p>July 16th.&mdash;Commissioner Cane had been holding an inquiry
at the Workhouse to &ldquo;ascertain the nature of the duties of
the various public officers and method of their
discharge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>July 19th.&mdash;Mr. Henry R. Harmer had been appointed an
Admiralty Commissioner.</p>
<p>July 23rd.&mdash;There had been a poll at Gorleston upon the
Church Rate question, which had resulted in a majority of 142
against that impost.</p>
<p>The Caister Lifeboat had been struck by lightning while on the
Beach and several persons who were taking shelter under her bow
injured.</p>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>July
26th.&mdash;At the Regatta the &ldquo;Audax,&rdquo; J. H.
Johnson, R.T.Y.C. won the yacht prize.&nbsp; In the yawl race the
&ldquo;Star of the East,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Queen Victoria,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Glance&rdquo; competed, and the former won.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Wanderer&rdquo; (Mr. J. L. Barber) won the River
Yachts&rsquo; match, and the &ldquo;Volunteer&rdquo; the small
Yawl match.</p>
<p>Aug. 6th.&mdash;Contains the following notice of &ldquo;The
Water Frolic:&mdash;This event, which was formerly important from
the fact of the &lsquo;new&rsquo; Mayor being then chosen, and
the official barge of the Mayor and Corporation being present,
came off on Monday afternoon, at that part of the Waveney
opposite Burgh Castle.&nbsp; No official patronage was given to
the affair, and consequently it was not, municipally, of any
weight.&nbsp; But as the weather was fine and sunny, with a
&lsquo;spanking&rsquo; southerly breeze, the yachts, which had
arranged to attend and compete in two races, were sure of good
sport, and the large crowds of persons who assembled early in the
day on the North Quay, augured well for the steamboats which Mr.
Fill&mdash;a worthy man of enterprise&mdash;always offers for the
accommodation of the public (pay or not pay) either for trips to
Cromer and Southwold, or even to Rotterdam fair, an event which
East Anglians of old were wont to delight in.&nbsp; At Burgh
there was a large assemblage of craft&mdash;wherries,
ships&rsquo; boats, punts, yachts, and, in fact, anything that
would safely float.&nbsp; Two matches were announced to take
place, each for a stake value at &pound;10, and the ordinary
river yachts were the competitors, with the exception of the new
and mischievous-looking boat of the High Sheriff of
Norfolk&mdash;a boat which, although it could not out-run Mr.
Barber&rsquo;s &lsquo;Flying Wanderer,&rsquo; will yet do credit
to her build.&nbsp; The &lsquo;public-house wherries,&rsquo; the
pie stalls, the acrobats, and the rest of the contributors to the
day&rsquo;s fun were all active and appeared to do a good
business.&nbsp; The yachting competition&mdash;which the public
ought to have considered the best business of the day&mdash;began
with a match for &pound;10, in which five cutter-rigged yachts
sailed, viz., Mr. Barber&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wanderer,&rsquo; Mr.
Nightingale&rsquo;s &lsquo;Red Rover,&rsquo; Mr. Read&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Belvidere,&rsquo; Mr. R. J. H. Harvey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lady
in White,&rsquo; and Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Bittern.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Wanderer had the advantage
throughout, and won&mdash;although she was occasionally closely
pressed by the Red Rover.&nbsp; The match extended over four
rounds.&nbsp; In the second match for a similar stake by latteens
the &lsquo;Vampire&rsquo; (Mr. Everett), the
&lsquo;Enchantress&rsquo; (Mr. Green), and the
&lsquo;Merlin&rsquo; (Mr. Humfrey) started, and continued in the
order named to the close.&nbsp; The &lsquo;frolicers&rsquo; then
commenced their homeward journey, and in the midst of music and
song all arrived safely, we believe, at the <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>Bridge
Foot, after spending a convivial, if not a dignified, half day on
the stream.&nbsp; The frolic, however, in the absence of official
support, is shorn of its ancient splendour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>August 13th.&mdash;The &ldquo;Order of Precedence of the
members of the Council&rdquo; had been printed.&nbsp; The Mayor
had requested the members of that body to accompany him to church
on Sundays, Good Friday, and Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Mr. S. Nightingale had backed his &ldquo;Red Rover&rdquo;
against Mr. Barber&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wanderer&rdquo; for four
matches at &pound;50 aside.</p>
<p>Thieves had &ldquo;drank the Sacramental wine and robbed the
Poor&rsquo;s box&rdquo; at the Independent Chapel, Gorleston.</p>
<p>August 16th.&mdash;At the Races, none of the Stewards (who
were Lord W. Powlett, Count Batthyany, and Sir H. J. Stracey,
Bart., M.P.,) had attended, and the usual Ball at the Town Hall
had not been held through lack of patronage.</p>
<p>August 20th.&mdash;The Yarmouth Cricket Club had played the
&ldquo;Visitors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The score was:&mdash;First Innings:
Yarmouth, 29; Visitors, 15.&nbsp; Second Innings: Yarmouth, 89;
Visitors, 32.&nbsp; Grand Totals: Yarmouth, 118; Visitors,
47.</p>
<p>August 23rd.&mdash;It was proposed to raise a Rifle Corps at
Ormesby.</p>

the Corporation to spend a day at Rackheath.</p>
<p>August 30th.&mdash;Sir E. Lacon, Bart., had been gazetted
Major of the N.A.V., (vice Marsh resigned.)</p>
<p>Sept. 3rd.&mdash;It was, at the Corporation&rsquo;s visit to
Rackheath, distinctly understood that Sir H. Stracey would offer
himself again as a candidate for the Borough, and that Mr. Watkin
was pledged to come forward again in the Liberal interest.</p>
<p>The Council had determined to place an illuminated clock on
the Town Hall.</p>
<p>The Southtown Barracks had been repaired at considerable
expense.</p>

Chipperfield had taken the ladies&rsquo; challenge cup from

Members&rsquo; prize.</p>
<p>Sept. 10th.&mdash;This shooting had been continued, and prizes
won by Sergeant Pearson, Sergeant Swann, and Volunteer
Barrett.</p>
<p>Sept. 17th.&mdash;The High Sheriff of Norfolk had given a
grand Volunteer Review and F&ecirc;te at Crown Point, the Norfolk
Artillery <a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Officers, 42 Non-Commissioned Officers, 105 Gunners, and 23 Band,

viz., one field Officer, 4 Captains, 8 Subalterns, 5 Staff, 12
Sergeants, 4 Drummers, 185 rank and file, and 16 Band.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Volunteers and some 2,000 guests were

&ldquo;the Liberal cause was much indebted to Mr. J. Eagleton,
their Yarmouth agent, whose exertions in the Registration Court,
in which the late Sir R. Peel said elections were to be won, had
been unceasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. G. V. Brooke was attracting crowded houses at the

8th.&mdash;At the Municipal Revision Court, Mr. John Clowes and

Palmer, Esq.) made an order quashing the Poor&rsquo;s Rate.&nbsp;
Mr. C. Cooper appeared on behalf of Mr. J. Clowes as appellant,
against the Churchwardens and Overseers, respondents in this
case.</p>
<p>At the Police Court, Mr. Gardiner, Editor of the <i>Yarmouth
Independent</i>, craved sureties of the peace against Mr. J. H.
Harrison, when, although the defendant called no evidence to
rebut the charge made against him, the Bench (by a majority of

complainant said he expected this when he saw such a &ldquo;drum
up&rdquo; of Magistrates &ldquo;who had been brought there as on
Licensing day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the evening &ldquo;the illuminations were on a most
extensive scale, scarcely a house without a transparency or
device.&nbsp; The designs on the Town Hall and Hospital School
were very beautiful, while many others on private houses were
greatly admired.&nbsp; On the Town Hall, facing the north, was
fixed the principal illumination, consisting of a magnificent
plume of feathers, having the letters &ldquo;A. A.&rdquo; on
either side, and partly encircled with a wreath of oak leaves and
acorns.&nbsp; The height of the design was 18 feet by 30 feet in
width, and was <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>drawn by Mr. Morant, Town Surveyor, and manufactured by
Mr. Doughty, of Gaol Street.&nbsp; The fireworks were continued
to a late hour, and we are happy to record that, notwithstanding
the pressure of the crowd, no accident occurred to mar the
pleasure of the day.&nbsp; The arrangements of the police
throughout were most satisfactory, and to the credit of our
townsmen it must be stated that at the Police Court the following
morning, the magistrates&rsquo; business was finished in two
minutes and a half, the only charge being a case of drunkenness,
which was graciously forgiven.&nbsp; The ball at the Town Hall
was fashionably and numerously attended and dancing was kept up
to the music of Hulley&rsquo;s quadrille band with unflagging
spirit until an early hour the following morning.&nbsp; During
the day the inmates of the Workhouse and Gaol were regaled, the
former at the expense of the Guardians, and the latter by the
Mayor.&nbsp; The inmates of the Fishermen&rsquo;s Hospital were
also regaled with plum pudding and roast beef, each man having,
in addition, a pipe of tobacco, with a liberal supply of
stout.&nbsp; The women also partook of tea, with a plentiful
supply of cake.&nbsp; The inmates expressed themselves deeply
grateful to the trustees of the charity for thus enabling them to
participate in the festivities of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And an amusing scene had taken place at the close of the poll

<p>Three thousand excursionists had arrived in one day from East
Suffolk.</p>
<p>July 18th.&mdash;The Channel Fleet, consisting of the
following ships (under the command of Rear-Admiral Dacres) was in
the Roads:&mdash;&ldquo;Edgar&rdquo; (flagship), 71 guns, 800
men, 600 horse-power, Captain Church; &ldquo;Emerald&rdquo;
(frigate), 35 guns, 510 men, 600 horse-power, Captain Cummings;
&ldquo;Liverpool,&rdquo; 39 guns, 540 men, 600 horse-power,
Captain Lambert; &ldquo;Black Prince&rdquo; (armour plated), 40
guns, 726 men, 1,200 horse-power, Captain Wainwright;
&ldquo;Royal Oak,&rdquo; 35 guns, 547 men, 800 horse-power,
Captain Campbell; &ldquo;Resistance,&rdquo; 16 guns, 482 men, 600
horse-power, Captain Chamberlin; &ldquo;Warrior,&rdquo; 40 guns,
706 men, <a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>1,200 horse-power, Captain Cochrane;
&ldquo;Defence,&rdquo; 16 guns, 468 men, 600 horse-power, Captain
Phillimore; &ldquo;Trinculo,&rdquo; (tender), 2 guns, 20
men.&nbsp; It was nearly dark by the time the last vessel of the
squadron took up her moorings; numbers of persons, nevertheless,
remained on the Beach to a late hour, watching the lights
displayed by the vessels as they laid at their anchorage.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock on Wednesday morning, a salute of
eleven guns was fired from the Admiral&rsquo;s ship, in
acknowledgment of the salute by the Volunteers the previous
evening.&nbsp; During the whole of Wednesday the fleet was
inspected by large numbers of visitors, who left the Britannia
Pier in steamers plying to and from the squadron at reasonable
fares, while the pier itself was the resort of many interested in
watching the constant arrival and departure of men-of-war boats,
freighted with provisions and stores, or in bringing officers on
shore on leave.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock, the Mayor, and a
party on board, left the bridge in the steamboat
&ldquo;Emperor,&rdquo; to pay an official visit to the
Admiral.&nbsp; The Mayor was accompanied on the occasion by C. J.
Palmer, W. Nightingale, C. C. Aldred, W. Holt, G. S. Shingles, W.
T. Foreman, W. Johnson, J. Clarke, B. Fenn, E. P. Youell, W.
Laws, J. H. Orde, J. Stephenson, and J. Bunn, Esqs.&nbsp; On
arriving at the flag-ship the party were most courteously
received by Captain Hornby, in the absence of the Admiral, who,
unfortunately, was on shore.&nbsp; After remaining a short time
inspecting the &ldquo;Edgar,&rdquo; the party proceeded to the
&ldquo;Warrior,&rdquo; where they were received by the Hon.
Captain Cochrane, who escorted them over the ship.&nbsp; This was
by far the most interesting feature of the excursion the powerful
armament and splendid construction of this truly noble vessel
exciting the admiration of all.&nbsp; The crew, numbering upwards
of 700, were all found busily engaged at their varied avocations,
some intent upon their drill at the huge Armstrong guns, while
others were pursuing more peaceful avocations.&nbsp; The interior
arrangements of the &ldquo;Warrior,&rdquo; as a ship of war, have
been so frequently and fully described, that it is unnecessary to
allude further to them, suffice it to say that, after viewing all
parts of the vessel, one could but feel that England had but
little to fear from foreign invasion, while guarded by such
bulwarks of defence.&nbsp; The Mayor, with his friends, having
made the tour of the fleet, returned to the Britannia Pier and
disembarked.&nbsp; The Mayor then proceeded to the Victoria
Hotel, where the Admiral was understood to be staying, but was
again unsuccessful in having an interview with him, as he had
just previously left to go on board his flag-ship.&nbsp; Under
these <a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>circumstances, the Mayor addressed a letter to the
gallant officer, expressing his regret at not meeting him, and
tendering on behalf of the town an invitation to himself and
officers to attend a ball at the Town Hall, on Monday evening,
expressing a hope that his arrangements would enable him to
accept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fleet were, however, compelled to leave on the Sunday
afternoon.</p>

party.</p>

were not used by the public.</p>

Nicholas&rsquo; Church in aid of the Columbia Mission.</p>

at the Priory-hall.&nbsp; &pound;90 was thus raised for the
Fund.</p>
<p>The Artillery Volunteers (170 strong) had been inspected by
Colonel Knox.</p>

illness had prevented him from taking any active part in the
administration of municipal matters.&nbsp; He was a Justice of
the Peace for the County of Norfolk as well as the Borough, and
also filled the office of Haven Commissioner.&nbsp; Mr. Palmer
throughout his long connection with the town was closely
identified with the trade and commerce of the port, being a large
shipowner, and deeply interested in the fisheries.&nbsp; His loss
will be felt by many, particularly among the poor, to whom he was
a true friend.&nbsp; As a tribute of respect to his memory, the

professedly confident of achieving a victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>July 12th.&mdash;Mr. Marshman had suddenly and unexpectedly
retired from the contest, and Mr. Brogden had issued an address
stating that Mr. Vanderbyl would take Mr. Marshman&rsquo;s place
as a candidate for the Borough; it was evident that &ldquo;the
struggle would be one of no ordinary character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmers in East Norfolk were agitating for a repeal of the
Malt Tax, and had adopted Mr. Clare Sewell Read as their
candidate.</p>
<p>July 15th.&mdash;Sir Thomas B. P. Beauchamp, Bart., had been
selected as a colleague of the Hon. Colonel Coke, the sitting
Liberal Member for that Division of the County.</p>

found in favour of Messrs. Brogden and Vanderbyl.</p>

description is given of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE ELECTION.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The very general expectation that prevailed as to the severity
of the contest drew early together large numbers of persons, who
thronged the vicinity of the polling places and the streets
throughout the day.&nbsp; The polling from eight to nine
o&rsquo;clock was very rapid, both parties striving their utmost
to bring up men so as to head the poll.&nbsp; The popular
feeling, which manifested itself unmistakeably in favour of the
Liberal cause, was sadly damped between the hours of nine and ten
o&rsquo;clock by the appearance of a placard bearing the state of
the poll, and showing that the Conservatives, notwithstanding the
activity displayed by the other side, had stolen a march upon
them, and meant winning.&nbsp; The result of the next
hour&rsquo;s polling had considerably increased the Conservative
majority, and, as a large proportion of the electors had voted,
it became evident that the battle, as far as Liberal interests
were concerned, was all but lost.&nbsp; As the day advanced, the
position of the Liberals on the poll became worse, and all chance
of retrieving their position was hopeless.&nbsp; The excitement
was very great in the town, but the crowd continued to conduct
themselves pretty quietly, contenting themselves with venting
their disappointment by groaning heartily at every vehicle
bearing placards of &ldquo;Vote for Lacon and Goodson.&rdquo;</p>

Ship</span>.&mdash;This novel specimen of marine architecture,

Friday last, and has since continued to be an object of great
curiosity among our seafaring population.&nbsp; The vessel, which

on an experimental cruise, with the view of thoroughly testing
her sea-going qualities.&nbsp; She is fitted with a screw
propeller, the fans of <a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>which are entirely submerged.&nbsp;
Her engines are of 35 horse power, but can be worked up to 50,
and it is stated she has attained a speed of 14 miles an
hour.&nbsp; The peculiarity of her build gives her a singular
appearance, her cone-shaped bow projecting for some distance
clear of the water, while her stern is more depressed.&nbsp; This

builders have sacrificed everything in her construction to attain
a high rate of speed, her berthing and general accommodation
being of an inferior character compared with other sea-going
steamers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Yarmouth it was stated that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;the proceedings throughout the day in
connection with the polling for this part of the district were
characterised by considerable excitement.&nbsp; The Conservatives
from the opening of the poll took a prominent position, and as
hour by hour passed away their majority steadily increased, until
by three o&rsquo;clock they were, according to their published
returns, nearly 400 ahead.&nbsp; No statement of the poll was
made during the day by the Liberals, but every exertion was made
to reduce the Conservative majority.&nbsp; Cabs and carriages
bearing placards of &ldquo;Vote for Wodehouse and Gurdon&rdquo;
were dashing about in all directions, keeping up the excitement;
but, despite every effort, the influence of the local candidate
proved too strong to be successfully resisted, and at four the
Conservative declaration of numbers showed the following
result:&mdash;</p>

325</span>The polling at Ormesby for the Hundreds of East and
West Flegg was also, as might have been anticipated, greatly in
favour of the Conservative candidates.&nbsp; Despite these
adverse returns, the Liberal agents were sanguine of better
results in other parts of the district, but their majorities at
Cromer, Wells, and Holt, failed to make any material change, so
far as the issue of the election was concerned, and it became at
length apparent that the hopes of the Liberal majority in North
Norfolk were at an end.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the excitement
engendered by the contest, the election was conducted throughout
with great good humour.&nbsp; During the day the streets and
approaches to the polling places were thronged by persons who
amused themselves by cheering and shouting in favour of their
respective candidates, but there was, during the afternoon, an
entire absence of the drunkenness and violence that characterised
previous borough elections.&nbsp; If the numbers polled be
examined, it will be found that in the county (excluding
Yarmouth) Mr. Wodehouse and Mr. Gurdon are in a slight
majority.&nbsp; It was in Yarmouth where the majority was
obtained, and which, we hear, will yet be found to have been
obtained by illegal practices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oct. 26th.&mdash;Mr. Robert Rising (of Horsey) had been

<p>Nov. 5th.&mdash;Owing to the extension of the franchise and
the &ldquo;split&rdquo; in the Conservative camp, the Municipal
Election had excited a good deal of attention, as the following
report shows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;MUNICIPAL ELECTION.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>As was expected, these elections were fought out with
considerable spirit, the town throughout the day presenting all
the aspects of a contested general election, cabs duly placarded
with the names and claims of the candidates rushing about the
streets in all directions <i>en route</i> to the various
polling-places or committee-rooms.</p>
<p>In the North Ward the Conservatives were early at work, and
were enabled to put their candidates considerably ahead, Messrs.
Worship and Hilton counting a formidable majority at an early
stage of the contest.&nbsp; The friends of Messrs. Neave and
Blyth were, however, far from dismayed, and worked with a degree
of zeal that certainly deserved if it did not ensure
success.&nbsp; In the course of the afternoon the Conservative
majority had been greatly reduced, and it looked at one time as
if Mr. Neave&rsquo;s return would have been secured.&nbsp; The
aspect of things nerved the Conservatives to renewed efforts and
enabled them to keep ahead of their opponents, the result being
the return of their candidates, Messrs. Worship and Hilton.</p>
<p><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>In
the Market Ward the greatest excitement prevailed, popular
feeling being in favour of Mr. J. Norman (L) and Mr. I.
Preston.&nbsp; The latter, although a Conservative, came forward
on independent grounds, and as opposed to the compromise that has
been entered into for the return of Messrs. Norman and
Combe.&nbsp; The last-named gentleman was brought out under the
auspices of that section of the Conservative party, better known
as the &ldquo;clique,&rdquo; which evoked the determined
opposition of the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; portion of the
party.&nbsp; There was another candidate in the person of Mr J.
Garratt (L), but that gentleman retired at an early stage of the
contest in favour of Mr. Combe.&nbsp; Soon after the commencement
of the polling, it became evident that Mr. Norman&rsquo;s
election would be safe, and that the real fight would be between
Messrs. Combe and Preston.&nbsp; The last-named had a large staff
of energetic supporters, and he was soon placed in a majority
which no efforts on the part of his opponents could break
down.&nbsp; The result, therefore, in this ward was the return of
Messrs. Norman and Preston, which must be regarded as a great
blow to the dominant section of the Conservative party, who
strained every nerve to carry their man.</p>
<p>The contest in the Regent Ward was of diminished interest as
compared with the other parts of the town, and resulted in the
return of the Conservative candidates, Messrs. Barber and
Tomlinson.&nbsp; Against these gentlemen were arrayed Messrs.
Woodger and Page; but the candidature of the two last-named was
carried on in a sort of guerilla fashion that evinced little
confidence in a successful result, and their respective chances
will be found very fully illustrated in the returns given at the
close of the poll.</p>
<p>In the St. George&rsquo;s Ward the battle was between Messrs.
Doughty and Baker, (C), and Messrs. Palmer and Hammond (L).&nbsp;
Here a most determined fight was made, the Liberals commencing
the business of the day in a style that evidently meant
winning.&nbsp; Soon after the first hour&rsquo;s polling, Messrs.
Palmer and Hammond took a commanding lead, and although the
utmost zeal was evinced on the part of their opponents, they kept
increasing their majority until by noon it had assumed such
proportions as to place the issue of the contest beyond all
question.&nbsp; The result was unexpected, and created quite a
sensation among the Conservatives, who chagrined at the turn of
affairs in the Market Ward, were little prepared for this fresh
source of annoyance and discomfiture.</p>
<p>In the Nelson Ward there was no contest, Messrs. Woolverton,
(C), and Stone (L) being unopposed.</p>
<p><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>The
election in the Southtown or St. Andrew&rsquo;s Ward was
provocative of the usual excitement, the Gorlestonians coming out
in considerable force, and testifying their Conservative or
Liberal proclivities in the liveliest manner.&nbsp; The
candidates were Messrs. Steward and Hammond, (C), as opposed to
Messrs. Beevor and Nelson.&nbsp; The contest was well fought
throughout, and resulted in the election of the Conservative
candidates.</p>
<p>In celebration of the victory in the St. George&rsquo;s Ward,
the Liberals paraded a band, which did honour to the occasion by
playing a selection of popular music through the principal
streets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">OFFICIAL
DECLARATION.</span></p>
<p>The official swearing-in of the newly-elected members took
place on Thursday afternoon, the proceedings creating more than
their wonted interest from the expectation of a
&ldquo;scene.&rdquo;&nbsp; These anticipations were fully
realised.&nbsp; Previous to the commencement of the usual
routine, Mr. J. F. Neave, one of the defeated Liberal candidates
in the North Ward, addressed Mr. S. Nightingale, and, in a tone
of considerable vehemence, charged that gentleman and his
supporters with having secured the election by unfair practices
by bringing forward individuals to personate voters who were dead
or at sea, or by other means equally discreditable.&nbsp; The
scene which ensued was of the most lively character, some
half-dozen Councillors speaking at once.&nbsp; Those in the body
of the Court showed their enjoyment by encouraging shouts of
&ldquo;Go it Neave,&rdquo; &ldquo;Give it them,&rdquo; an appeal,
however, which was scarcely necessary, as the North Ward champion
appeared in fine mettle, and continued his address, although the
greater part of it was lost in the general turmoil.&nbsp;
Referring to the result, Mr. Nightingale was understood to say
that Mr. Neave would never be so near winning again, which
elicited a rejoinder from the latter that he had been told he
should never be elected a Guardian, but he had shown them what he
could do, and if he were spared he would yet be in the
Council.&nbsp; This declaration of future hostilities was
received with great uproar, which was with difficulty quelled
sufficiently to enable the business of the meeting to be
proceeded with.&nbsp; This having been brought to a termination,
after sundry interruptions, the newly-elected hastily quitted the
Court, the proceedings having afforded a singular exhibition of
political amenities, from a Yarmouth point of view.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We regret to record the death of this
gentleman who expired suddenly at his residence in Cambridge, on
Saturday evening.&nbsp; Mr. Steward for a number of years
occupied a very prominent position in this borough, having filled
the office of Chief Magistrate on five occasions.&nbsp; He was
until recently an active member of the Town Council, having
represented the Southtown or St. Andrew&rsquo;s Ward for a
lengthened period, during which time he exhibited a warm interest
in all that related to the welfare of the borough.&nbsp; Mr.
Steward was one of the first to associate himself with the
Volunteer movement, and was ever ready with his purse to aid the
cause.&nbsp; It was the occasion of his fifth election to the
Mayoralty that his fellow-townsmen determined to present him with
a testimonial in recognition of his public services, and so
heartily was the appeal responded to, that a sum was soon raised
sufficient for the purchase of a handsome service of plate, which
was publicly presented at the Town Hall.&nbsp; Latterly Mr.
Steward had been suffering from failing health, and had taken up
his residence at Cambridge, but on all occasions when anything of
public interest was under discussion he was at his accustomed
post in the Town Council.&nbsp; Mr. Steward was a Justice of the
Peace for the Borough, and also for the County of Suffolk.&nbsp;
As a public man his loss will be much felt, for though
occasionally overbearing and impetuous, his faults were
overlooked in the thorough earnestness with which he applied
himself to the promotion of those measures which he considered
for the general good.&nbsp; Out of respect the flags on the Town
Hall and shipping have been hoisted half-mast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

Council for the Southtown Ward.</p>

<blockquote><p>Previous to the declaration of the numbers by the
returning officer,</p>
<p>Mr. John Cooper, on behalf of the Conservative candidates, who
had met the previous night, announced his intention not to
proceed with the scrutiny before the returning officer, who had
no authority to call witnesses, but stated that the whole conduct
of the election would be laid before the Poor Law Board with a
view to a thorough enquiry being instituted.&nbsp; The election
had been conducted in a fraudulent manner.&nbsp; Mr. Cooper, in
support of his assertion, instanced the case of Hurr, one <a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>of the
collectors, who, he alleged, had only returned 113 papers out of
300.&nbsp; Names had also been put on various papers without
authority, while the collector (Hurr) had taken his papers to the
house of one of the candidates, where they were examined and
sorted.&nbsp; Another collector in the Liberal interest, named
Norman, had been convicted and sentenced to twelve months&rsquo;
imprisonment for robbery.&nbsp; Mr. Cooper went on to say that in
the Market Ward (Hurr&rsquo;s district) upwards of twenty papers
had never been called for, and he understood that there were
upwards of 50 which had been signed by one person.&nbsp; The
election had been conducted in such an unfair and scandalous
manner, that the Conservatives had resolved upon demanding a Poor
Law enquiry.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston said it would be for Mr. Cooper and his friends
to make good the allegations just made.&nbsp; He hoped if there
had been any irregularity it would be fully enquired into.</p>
<p>Mr. J. A. Norman (who headed the poll for the Market Ward)
supposed that Mr. Cooper had suspected the Liberals had been
adopting the former tactics of their opponents, and had taken a
leaf out of their book.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Mr. Overend (another successful candidate for the Market Ward)
denied that the papers had been sorted in the shop as alleged,
and said the collector called for information.</p>
<p>Mr. Cufaude (the Returning-officer) said the collector ought
not to have done this, as it was most irregular and contrary to
the instructions given to the collectors.&nbsp; He then gave the
return as above, and the proceedings closed.</p>
<p>The result has caused considerable heart-burning among the
Conservatives, who have so long held the sway in all matters
pertaining to local administration, and they cannot be expected
to view with equanimity the storming of one of their chief
strongholds by the enemy.</p>

<p>May 10th.&mdash;Records the death of Richard Hammond, Esq., as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;It is with deep regret that we announce the
death of this much respected gentleman, who expired at his
residence, Regent Road, on Saturday morning last, after a rather
lengthened illness.&nbsp; Mr. Hammond during his long career has
occupied so prominent a position, and has ranked so high in the
opinion of all classes of his fellow-townsmen, that his death,
although regarded as imminent, created much sensation.&nbsp; The
deceased, who was born in 1792, and was consequently at the time
of his decease in his 79th year, was one of the oldest
Magistrates of the borough, having been called to the Bench in
1841.&nbsp; During the long period that Mr. Hammond was
associated with the administration of justice he was remarkable
for his uprightness and thorough independence of character.&nbsp;
Wealthy, but yet conspicuous for his unostentatious mode of life,
he was at all times accessible to those of his poorer fellow
townsmen, many of whom were wont to seek his counsel, and
advice.&nbsp; In the exercise of his magisterial functions, he
was ever disposed to temper justice with mercy, and in his death
there must be many who must feel that they have lost a true and
valued friend.&nbsp; The deceased for many years occupied a
leading position as among the most prominent, forward, yet
consistent members of the Liberal party, and although he had of
late ceased to take any active part in political controversies,
he was always deeply interested in everything that pertained to
the advancement of the cause which he had so greatly at
heart.&nbsp; Mr. Hammond, who was largely connected at one time
with the fisheries, had also a considerable stake in the shipping
of the port, and accumulated a large property, the bulk of which
will, doubtless, have been bequeathed to his three nieces, as he
was unmarried.&nbsp; Out of respect to the deceased, the flags on
the Town Hall, public buildings, and shipping have been hoisted
half-mast, while many private families have shown similar marks
of regard to the memory of the deceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Guardians had decided to allow Nonconformist Ministers to
visit at the Workhouse.</p>
<p>May 17th.&mdash;One boat had landed 1,000 mackerel, and that
fish was selling at from 20s. to 25s. per hundred.</p>
<p>May 20th.&mdash;The late Mr. Hammond had left the following
charitable legacies:&mdash;Hospital, &pound;50; Sailors&rsquo;
Home, &pound;19 19s.; Priory schools, &pound;50; <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>and St.
John&rsquo;s, St. Andrew&rsquo;s, St. Peter&rsquo;s and Primitive
Methodist schools, &pound;19 19s. each.</p>
<p>The cost of taking the census had amounted to &pound;110
15s.</p>
<p>June 3rd.&mdash;Records the death of David A. Gourlay, Esq.,
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;We regret to record the death of this
gentleman, who expired at his residence on Wednesday, at the
advanced age of 89 years.&nbsp; During his long connection with
the town, Mr. Gourlay contrived to amass considerable wealth,
having been largely connected with the shipping interest of the
port.&nbsp; The deceased was a much respected member of the
Liberal party in the borough, and in 1849 filled the office of
Mayor.&nbsp; He was also a Magistrate, having been placed on the
roll of Justices in 1858, and for many years represented the
Market Ward in the Town Council, which position he only resigned
last year.&nbsp; Mr. Gourlay was of a singularly quiet habit,
devoting his entire time to business pursuits, which he continued
until advancing years and infirmities compelled retirement.&nbsp;
The deceased was deeply interested in the educational movements
of the town, and a few years since presented the magnificent
donation of &pound;1,000 towards the Wesleyan Schools.&nbsp; As a
mark of respect to his memory the flags on the Town Hall and
shipping have been hoisted half mast.&nbsp; The number of borough
magistrates who have died since 1863 has now reached
15.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June 10th.&mdash;There had been a stormy discussion in the
Council with regard to the proposal to appoint Messrs. Salmon
Palmer, Garson Blake, and John W. de Caux, Justices for the
Borough, when Mr. James W. Bunn moved, and Mr. C. Woolverton
seconded a resolution to the effect that such appointments
&ldquo;would be objectionable&rdquo;; and Mr. F. Danby-Palmer
moved, and Mr. James Scott seconded an amendment approving such
appointments, which was lost by 25 to 7 votes, those voting in
the minority being Messrs. F. Danby-Palmer, J. Scott, Frederick
Palmer, J. W. de Caux, T. W. Attwood, H. Hammond, and J. A.

<p>Mr. Attwood declined to vote.&nbsp; After the voting the
following &ldquo;scene&rdquo; took place between the Mayor and
Mr. Harmer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Harmer said he had come forward as a
candidate, considering his long connection with the party
entitled him to their support.&nbsp; He could not let that
opportunity pass without expressing his thanks to those gentleman
who had accorded him their votes.&nbsp; He could but think if the
Mayor had fought a &lsquo;manly and open game&rsquo;&mdash;(cries
of &lsquo;no, no,&rsquo; and uproar)&mdash;and postponed his
canvassing from the Saturday to the Monday, he should have been
in a very different position there that day.&nbsp; (Renewed
cheers and uproar.)&nbsp; He believed he should have had most of
those promises which the Mayor had obtained on the Sunday.&nbsp;
(Cries of &lsquo;no, no,&rsquo; and general uproar.)&nbsp; He
felt certain that a great many of his friends in the Council whom
he had known many years, and who had been induced to vote against
him, were sorry for it, and had only been led to do so by the
promise given the Mayor on Sunday.&nbsp; (Cries and groans and
general tumult in the gallery.)&nbsp; He met an old friend the
other day, and on asking him for his vote, he replied, &lsquo;I
am very sorry I cannot give it you, as I promised the Mayor on
Sunday&mdash;(cheers and laughter)&mdash;but you have my
sympathy, and I hope you may win.&rsquo;&nbsp; He (Mr. Harmer)
could not help replying, &lsquo;Hang your sympathy; give me your
vote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Mayor said he could not let Mr. Harmer&rsquo;s remarks
upon himself pass without comment.&nbsp; Coming home quietly from
church on the Sunday morning referred to following the
mace-bearers, Mr. Harmer came up to him and canvassed him for the
Clerkship of the Peace, Mr. Cufaude not being then dead.&nbsp;
(Hear, hear, and uproar.)&nbsp; He told Mr. Harmer that Mr.
Cufaude was not dead and (he might as well tell them all that
passed), said he hoped to God he might live till after March, so
that they (the Conservatives) might have the opportunity of
fighting the Guardians.&nbsp; (Cheers and counter cheers.)&nbsp;
In walking down to the Station-house he said to Mr. Harmer, if
that should be the case, and they should get a majority at the
Board of Guardians, Mr. Harmer could go in for the Clerk of the
Guardians, and he (the Mayor) for the Clerk of the
Peace,&mdash;(loud laughter)&mdash;and that they could work
together.&nbsp; Mr. Harmer replied by saying that he should go in
for both appointments&mdash;(cheers and laughter)&mdash;and he
(the Mayor) replied that he could not do so, but if he (the
Mayor) won one, he would support Mr. Harmer <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>in the
other, and if Mr. Harmer was successful in one, he could give him
his help in trying to obtain the other appointment for his
son.&nbsp; (Hear, hear.)&nbsp; In the afternoon of that day Mr.
Cufaude died, and as he knew Mr. Harmer was canvassing, did they
think he was such a fool as to let him outstep him.&nbsp; (Cheers
and uproar.)</p>
<p>Mr. Harmer rose to reply, but the confusion became so great
owing to the shouting and recrimination, backed up by the
adherents of the respective parties in the gallery, that scarcely
anything could be heard amid the din of words.&nbsp; During a
temporary lull in the storm,</p>
<p>Mr. Harmer, who was still speaking excitedly, was understood
to say that he did not go between the bark and the tree, but that
he wished to tell the whole truth about the conversation between
him and the Mayor.&nbsp; He asked the Mayor how Mr. Cufaude was,
and he replied that he was very bad indeed, and not expected to
live.&nbsp; (At this juncture of Mr. Harmer&rsquo;s reply several
of the Councillors vacated their seats, and left the room, and
the disorder which had calmed down a little again broke
out.&nbsp; Mr. Harmer, thus interrupted, stopped in his speech,
but in response to cries of &lsquo;go on, go on,&rsquo; from the
public, he turned himself to the gallery, and addressing the
occupants of that place, continued his remarks.)&nbsp; He said he
observed to the Mayor&mdash;&lsquo;In case anything happens, what
do you intend to do?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Mayor replied &lsquo;If my
son comes forward I must support him,&rsquo; to which he (Mr.
Harmer) replied &lsquo;very naturally, too.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then
told the Mayor that he should be a candidate for the Clerkship of
the Peace, and as they walked down Regent-street the Mayor
remarked to him, &lsquo;If we can only keep the poor fellow alive
till after the next election of Guardians, then we must all put
our hands into our pockets and turn them (the Liberals)
out.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Cries of &lsquo;Shame,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Bribery,&rsquo; and general uproar.)&nbsp; The Mayor then
said &lsquo;I will propose that you shall be Clerk of the Peace
and Isaac, Clerk of the Guardians.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Cheers and
laughter.)&nbsp; His answer to that generous proposition was,
&lsquo;I shall not stand that; I shall expect the better berth of
the two.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Renewed laughter, and cries of &lsquo;Go
in Harmer.&rsquo;)&nbsp; The Mayor said &lsquo;Well, after all,
perhaps Isaac would rather have the Clerkship of the Peace, as
there is not much to do, and as he is going to be married, and
will be very well off, he won&rsquo;t want it.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Loud
laughter.)</p>
<p>Here the confusion became so great that nothing could be
heard, and as by this time the majority of the Councillors had
dispersed, the proceedings closed amid wild uproar.</p>

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
